The files in this directory contain fragments of the configuration files
that are installed by the setup script in the src/, and bld/ directories.

Files in the make/config directory contain source files for the main
config.mk configuration file and the namespace level config.mk that 
are installed in each build directory by the setup script. 

Each file in the make/compiler directory contains a set of makefile
definitions that are appropriate to a particular combination of compiler, 
mpi library, and operating system environment. The contents of one of
these files is incorporated into the main config.mk file in each build
directory by the setup script. The file "make/compiler/default" is used 
if no other choice is specified.  The name of a different file in the
make compiler directory can be passed to the setup script as a command 
line argument. For example, one would invoke "./setup homebrew-m1" to 
use the definitions given in a file make/compiler/homebrew-m1, which
are for a Mac with the homebrew package manager and an apple silicon 
cpu. Users may create new files in this directory to save more 
specialized settings required in their own environment.
