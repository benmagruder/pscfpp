Issue to consider for creation of complex field theory:

1) Use of explicit double values in some solver templates

Proposed solution: 

   -  Make Pscf::Species a template with a type parameter Scalar.
      Define mu_, phi_ and q_ to be type Scalar.

   -  Add a template parameter Scalar (scalar type) as a final parameter 
      for all solver template classes.

   -  Add a default value Scalar = double for Scalar template parameter
      for Species and Solver classes so that some current derived classes
      (for r1d and rpc) can remain unchanged.

   - Look for and consider other uses of double in the solver templates

2) Reconsider use of typdefs used to define single and double precision
   real numbers for variables defined on the GPU.

   - Status: Not yet analyzed or resolved.

   - Status: Upon rereading this comment in Oct. 2024, it's not clear
      to me what the problem is. Maybe keeping the cudaReal and cudaComplex
      typedefs is fine.
