--------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.1

Tools:
------

1) Develop python scripts to read output files and analyze sweeps.


Documentation:
-------------
1) Add documentation for building on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.2

Pscf
-----

1) Change treatment of phases in Basis to explicitly store and manipulate
Rational number phases, compute floating point coefficients only at the 
very end.

2) Introducing new v2.0 field file formats for basis and rgrid. 
Basis would contain the mesh. Rgrid would be output in convention C order.

3) Introduce a convention in Basis in which pairs of related open stars 
are always listed in the same order (this helps complete the basis field 
API).

Pspc:
-----

1) Introduce working prototype of Field Theoretic Monte Carlo (v1.2?)

Docs:

1) Develop read-the-docs user manual documentation (?)

2) Improve developer documentation regarding build system, Parameter IO

Pspg:
-----

1) Introduce working prototype of Field Theoretic Monte Carlo (v1.2?)

2) Review and clean up redundant GPU kernels (leave for v1.1?)

Docs
-----

1) Write a first draft of a latex algorithms and theory manual, or 
publish as an article in a computational science oriented journal.
