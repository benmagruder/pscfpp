In a field theoretic treatment of an incompressible system, the
partial-saddle approximation (PSA) is an approximation for the
treatment of the pressure like field that acts to constrain the 
total density. When it is applicable, the approximation yields a
theory with real statistical weights for all allowed field 
configurations.

\section psfts_psa_ab_sec AB Systems (\f$ M = 2 \f$)

We first consider the PSA for an incompressible standard AB system with 
\f$ \chi > 0 \f$.  In the fully fluctuating theory for such a system, 
the partition function can be expressed as an functional integral over 
a real exchange field \f$ W_{-} \f$ and an imaginary pressure-like 
field \f$ W_{-}({\bf r}) = i\omega_{+} \f$.  

In the PSA for such a system, \f$ Z \f$ is approximated by functional
integral with respect to \f$ W_{-} \f$ in which the Hamiltonian 
\f$ H \f$ is evaluated in a configuration in which \f$ W_{+} \f$ is 
chosen so as to give a vanishing partial functional derivative of
\f$ H \f$ with respect to \f$ W_{+}({\bf r}) \f$. 
This yields an approximate for the partition function as an integal
\f[
   Z = \frac{1}{N} \int DW_{-} \; e^{-H[ W_{-}, W_{+}^{*}]}
\f]
in which \f$ \int D W_{-} \f$ denotes a functional integral over 
the exchange field \f$ W_{-} \f$, while \f$ W_{+}^{*} \f$ denotes 
a configuration of \f$ W_{+}({\bf r}) \f$ that is chosen to satisfy 
the so-called partial-saddle point condition
\f[
    0 = \left .  \frac{ \delta H } { \delta W_{+}({\bf r}) } 
    \right |_{W_{-}}
    =  \frac{1}{v} 
   \left [ \phi_{1}{\bf r}) + \phi_{2}({\bf r}) - 1\right ]
\f]
for all \f$ {\bf r} \f$.
Note that this condition is satisfied if and only if
\f$ \phi_{1}({\bf r}) + \phi_{2}({\bf r}) = 1 \f$. 
Partial saddle-point field configurations thus satisfy a mean-field
version of the incompressibility constraint that is identical to 
the form of this constraint used in SCFT. SCFT solutions also satisfy
the requirement that \f$ \delta H/\delta W_{-}({\bf r}) = 0 \f$, 
however, while PS-FTS methods allow \f$ W_{-}({\bf r}) \f$ to 
fluctuate.

Partial saddle-point field configuration for states characterized
by a real-valued exchange field \f$ W_{-}({\bf r}) \f$ always have
a real-valued field \f$ W_{+}({\bf r}) \f$, corresponding to a pure 
imaginary value of \f$ \omega_{+}({\bf r}) \f$.
Such a field configurations always yields real monomer w-fields 
fields, given by
\f[
   w_{1}({\bf r}) =  W^{*}_{+}({\bf r}) + W_{-}({\bf r})  \quad
\f]
\f[
   w_{2}({\bf r}) =  W^{*}_{+}({\bf r}) - \omega_{+}({\bf r})  \quad,
\f]
and also yields real values for \f$ \ln Z_{\rm id}[w] \f$ and 
the Hamiltonian \f$ H \f$. 

\section psfts_psa_general_sec General Case (\f$ M \geq 2 \f$)

The current version of PSCF (v1.2) allows PS-FTS simulations of some 
systems with M > 2, subject to a constraint on allowed values of the 
\f$ \chi \f$ parameters:  The implementation of the PSA in the current 
version of PSCF is applicable if and only if the nontrivial eigenvalues 
of the projected \f$ \chi \f$ matrix, 
\f$ \lambda_{1}, \ldots \lambda_{M-1} \f$,
are all negative.  This requirement is a generalization of the 
requirement that \f$ \chi > 0 \f$ in a standard AB system, which can be 
shown to be equivalent in that case to a requirement that 
\f$ \lambda_{1} < 0 \f$.

To discuss the generalized PSA for such systems, it is convenient to 
adopt a modified notation analogous to that used for AB systems, in
which we use \f$ \omega_{-} \f$ as short-hand for the list of fields
\f[
   \omega_{-} = [\omega_{1}, \ldots, \omega_{M-1}] \quad,
\f]
which we refer to collectively as exchange fields, while using 
\f$ W_{+} \f$ as an alternate symbol for the pressure-like field 
\f$ W_{M} \f$. Using this notation, we may express the generalized 
PSA for such systems as an integral 
\f[
   Z = \frac{1}{N} \int D\omega_{-} \; e^{-H[\omega_{-}, W_{+}^{*}]}
\f]
in which \f$ \int D\omega_{-} \f$ denotes a functional integral over 
the \f$ M - 1 \f$ real exchange fields 
\f$ \omega_{-} = [\omega_1, \ldots, \omega_{M-1}] \f$, and in which 
\f$ W_{+}^{*} \f$ denotes a real configuration of 
\f$ W_{+}({\bf r}) \f$ that is chosen to satisfy a criterion 
requiring that 
\f[
    0 = \left . 
    \frac{ \delta H }
         { \delta W_{+}({\bf r}) } 
    \right |_{\omega_{-}}
    \quad.
\f]
As for an AB system, the requirement that 
\f$ \delta H[\omega]/\delta W_{+}({\bf r}) = 0 \f$ can be shown to 
be equivalent to a requirement that 
\f[
    \sum_{i=}^{M} \phi_{i}({\bf r}) = 1
    \quad.
\f]
In cases to which this approximation applies (those for which
\f$ \lambda_{1}, \ldots, \lambda_{M-1} \f$ are all negative) this 
approximation leads to real values for all monomer fields and for 
the Hamiltonian \f$ H \f$. 

Morse, Yong and Chen 
(<https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.macromol.4c02636>)
have proposed a further generalization of the PSA so as to treat cases in 
which one or more eigenvalues of the projected \f$ \chi \f$ matrix are 
positive. This further generalization is not implemented in v1.2 of PSCF.
