The pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs are both be used to perform
stochastic field theoretic simulation (FTS) calculations in a
partial-saddle (PSA) approximation, using either Brownian dynamics
(BD) or Monte Carlo (MC) sampling algorithms. The partial saddle
approximation for field theoretic simulation (PS-FTS) yields a
statistical ensemble for fluctuating real valued monomer chemical
potential fields ("w fields") in which each field configuration 
has a real statistical weight. The resulting theory yields fields 
that tend to fluctuate around an SCFT solution when applied to 
systems of very long, strongly overlapping polymers, corresponding 
to large invariant degrees of polymerization \f$ \overline{N} \f$.
PS-FTS yields predictions for thermodynamic properties that 
approach those of SCFT in the limit of infinitely long chains
(\f$ \overline{N} \rightarrow \infty \f$), and that also rather
accurately describe some effects of strong composition fluctuations 
that are important for typical experimental chain lengths.

The description of the implementation of PS-FTS in PSCF given in
the following subpages describes the implementation in either 
pscf_pc or pscf_pg, which have equivalent features and identical
interfaces for this type of calculation. The first two pages of
this discussion provide an overview of the underlying theory.
