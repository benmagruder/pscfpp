\section psfts_perturb_overview_sec Overview

The ramp and perturbation features of PSCF can both be used, together or
separately, to implement calculations in which free energy differences 
are computed by thermodynamic integration. Thermodynamic integration is 
a technique in which the difference in free energies between two states 
characterized by different values for some parameter are computed by 
numerically evaluating the integral of a quantity that is equal to the
derivative of the free energy with respect to the parameter of interest. 

Introduction of a ramp allows the user to perform a calculation in 
which one or more of the parameters that define the Hamiltonian vary 
continuously over the course of the simulation. One reason to do this is 
as a method of approximately identifying a phase transition, such as an 
order-disorder transition, by looking for evidence of a spontaneous phase 
transformation that occurs during such a simulation. Another possible 
purpose of this is to allow implementation of continuous thermodynamic 
integration calculations. Continuous thermodynamic integration is a 
technique in which the integral of some property with respect to 
variation of a parameter is approximately computed by slowly varying 
the relevant parameter during the simulation and computing the time 
integral of the quantity of interest. 

Introduction of a perturbation allows the user to define an arbitrary 
modification of the field theoretic Hamiltonian, thus creating a model
with a field theoretic Hamiltonian that may have a different functional
form than that obtained in the standard model used in PSCF. Thus far, 
the main use for this has been as a framework for implementing the 
Einstein crystal method of computing free energies. 

The ramp and perturbation features may be combined by using a ramp to 
vary a parameter that governs the magnitude of a perturbation.  
Application of this technique to the Einstein crystal method is
described below.

Use of a Perturbation and/or Ramp may be enabled by adding a corresponding
block or blocks within the Simulator block of the parameter file. The
Perturbation and Ramp blocks are optional selectable subblocks of the
BdSimulator or McSimulator block that, if present, appear after the
Compressor. If both a Perturbation and a Ramp are present, the 
Perturbation appears before the Ramp.  The format for BdSimulator that 
uses both a perturbation and a Ramp is thus
\code
  BdSimulator{
    seed*    int
    BdStep#{ ... }
    Compressor#{ ... }
    Perturbation*#{ ... }
    Ramp*#{ ... }
    AnalyzerManager*{ ... }
  }
\endcode
The corresponding format for an McSimulator is
\code
  McSimulator{
    seed*    int
    McMoveManager{ ... }
    Compressor*#{ ... }
    Perturbation*#{ ... }
    Ramp*#{ ... }
    AnalyzerManager*{ ... }
  }
\endcode
Here, as elsewhere in this documentation, the symbol "\*\#" after the 
generic names Perturbation and Ramp indicates that these blocks are
both optional (i.e., may be omitted) and selectable.

Though both Perturbation and Ramp are implemented as selectable blocks, 
there is currently only on type of Perturbation available (named 
EinsteinCrystalPerturbation) and only one type of Ramp (named 
LinearRamp).  These two classes may be used separately or combined to 
perform a Einstein crystal calculation using continuous thermodynamic
integration.
