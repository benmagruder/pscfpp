The PS-FTS simulation method used in PSCF is derived by applying the
partial-saddle point approximation to an exact fully-fluctuating field 
theoretic formulation of the partition function for an incompressible 
polymer fluid.  The underlying particle-based model and its 
field-theoretic formulation are discussed below. 

We consider a mixture of polymers and solvents constructed from \f$ M \f$ 
different types of monomer. The variable \f$ M \f$ used in this discussion
is equivalent to the parameter nMonomer that appears in a PSCF parameter 
file.  Let \f$ c_{i}({\bf r}) \f$ denote the concentration of monomers of 
type \f$ i \f$ at point \f$ {\bf r} \f$ within the mixture in a specific 
mechanical microstate of the underlying particle based model. Partcular 
attention is given here to the common special case of systems with only
two types of monomer (\f$ M = 2 \f$), also known as AB systems.

The implementation of PS-FTS in PSCF is designed for a type of 
incompressible model in which the monomer concentrations are assumed
to rigorously satisfy a incompressibility constraint 
\f[
   \sum_{i=1}^{M} c_{i}({\bf r}) = c_{0}
\f]
for all \f$ {\bf r} \f$ , where \f$ c_{0} = 1/v \f$ is the total 
mononer concentration and \f$ v = 1/c_{0} \f$ is the corresponding 
monomer reference volume (denoted by vMonomer in the parameter file). 

Throughout this and subsequent theoretic discussions of particle-field
transformations, we use units for energy in which \f$ k_{B} T = 1 \f$.

\section psfts_theory_model_sec Incompressible Model (Particle-Based)

In the particle-based model used by PSCF for PS-FTS calculations, the 
potential energy for states that satisfy the incompressibility 
constraint is taken to be of the form
\f[
   U = U_{\rm id} + U_{\rm int}
   \quad, 
\f]
in which \f$ U_{\rm id} \f$ is the intramolecular potential energy of 
a gas of non-interacting Gaussian chains, and in which
\f[
   U_{\rm int} 
    =  \frac{v}{2} 
   \int d{\bf r} \; \chi_{ij} c_{i}({\bf r}) c_{j}({\bf r}) 
\f]
is a non-bonded pair interaction energy with local interactions.
Here, \f$ \chi_{ij} \f$ is an element of a symmetric \f$ M \times M \f$ 
matrix of Flory-Huggins interaction parameters, which is dimensionless
because \f$U_{\rm int}\f$ is expressed in units with \f$ k_{B} T = 1 \f$.
Here and hereafter, we adopt the Einstein convention for summations over 
repeated indices \f$ i \f$ or \f$ j \f$ that represent monomer type 
indices, which are sums from \f$ 1, \ldots, M \f$ .

Consider the commonly studied case of AB systems, with \f$ M = 2 \f$.
For simplicity, when considering such systems, we focus on a model 
in which the chi matrix has vanishing diagonal components, 
\f$ \chi_{11} = \chi_{22} = 0 \f$, and a positive value denoted by
\f$ \chi \f$ for the off-diagonal components,
\f$ \chi = \chi_{12} = \chi_{21} \f$, \f$ \chi > 0 \f$.
We refer to such systems in what follows as standard AB systems.
The potential energy for such a system is given by
\f[
   U_{\rm int} 
   =  v \chi 
   \int d{\bf r} c_{1}({\bf r}) c_{2}({\bf r})
\f]
with \f$ \chi > 0 \f$.
At the time of writing of these notes (Oct. 2024), all published
PS-FTS calculations had treated on such standard AB systems.

The partition function \f$ Z \f$ for an incompressible particle-based
model with any value of \f$ M \f$ can be expressed to within an 
irrelevant multiplicative constant as a configurational integral
\f[
   Z = \int {\cal D}{\bf r} \; e^{-U_{\rm id} - U_{\rm int} }
       \; 
       \delta \left ( \sum_{i=1}^{M} c_{i}({\bf r}) - c_{0} \right )
   \quad,
\f]
in which the \f$ \delta \f$-functional imposes the incompressibility 
constraint.

\section psfts_theory_AB_sec Field Theory: Standard AB Systems (\f$ M=2 \f$)

We first consider the case of standard AB systems, as described above.
To describe this, it is convenient to define concentration components
\f[
  C_{-}({\bf r}) = c_{1}({\bf r} - c_{2}({\bf r})
  \quad\quad
  C_{+}({\bf r}) = c_{1}({\bf r} + c_{2}({\bf r}) \quad.
\f]
Note that the incompressibility constraint requires that 
\f$ C_{+}({\bf r}) = c_{0} \f$ for all \f$ {\bf r} \f$, while 
\f$ C_{-}({\bf r}) \f$ fluctuates.
Rewriting the potential energy \f$ U_{\rm int} \f$ in terms of these 
variables yields
\f[
   U_{\rm int} 
   =  \frac{1}{4} v \chi 
   \int d{\bf r} 
   [ \; C_{+}^{2} ({\bf r}) - C_{-}^{2}({\bf r}) + c_{0}^{2} \; ] 
   \quad,
\f]
where we now may set \f$ C_{+}({\bf r}) = c_{0} \f$ within the 
integrand.

<b> Particle-Field Transformation </b>

The factor of \f$ \exp( -U_{\rm int} ) \f$ in the configurational
integral that defines \f$ Z \f$ may be re-expressed as a functional
integeral over an auxiliary field by applying a Hubbard-Stratonovich 
transformation. For the case \f$ \chi > 0 \f$ of interest here, this 
yields
\f[
   e^{-U_{\rm int} }
   =  \frac{1}{N} 
   \int {\cal D}\omega_{-}
   \exp \left \{ - 
   \int \! d{\bf r} \; \left [  \;
    \frac{ \omega_{\alpha}^{2}}{ v \chi}
          + \omega_{\alpha} C_{\alpha} 
          + \frac{\chi}{4} \;
   \right ] \right \}
   \; ,
\f]
where \f$ \int {\cal D} \omega_{-} \f$ denotes a functional integral 
over a real-valued field \f$ \omega_{-}({\bf r}) \f$, and where
\f[
   N \equiv
   \int {\cal D} \omega_{-}
   \exp \left \{ 
   - \int \! d{\bf r} \; 
   \frac{\omega_{-}^{2}}{v \chi }  
   \right \}
\f]
is a constant.

The \f$ \delta \f$-function that constrains the total monomer 
concentration may also be expressed as a functional integral
\f[
   \delta(c({\bf r}) - c_{0}) = 
   \int {\cal D}\omega_{+} \exp \left \{ 
   - i \int d{\bf r} \; \omega_{+} [ \; C_{M} - c_{0} \; ]
   \right \} 
\f]
in which \f$ \omega_{+}({\bf r}) \f$ is a fluctuating real-valued
Lagrange multplier field that imposes the constraint requiring 
that \f$ C_{M}({\bf r}) = c_{0} \f$, for all \f$ {\bf r} \f$, and 
\f$ \int {\cal D}\omega_{+} \f$ is a functional integral over 
this field.

Substituting the field-theoretic expressions for \f$ e^{-U_{\rm int}} \f$ 
and the \f$ \delta \f$-function into the definition of the \f$ Z \f$ for
an incompressible system, we obtain
\f[
   Z = N^{-1} 
   \int {\cal D}\omega \; e^{ -H_{\rm f} }
   \int \! {\cal D}{\bf r} \; e^{-U_{\rm id} - H_{\rm c}}
   \quad,
\f]
in which \f$ \int {\cal D}\omega \f$ denotes an integral over both
\f$ \omega_{-} \f$ and \f$ \omega_{+} \f$, and
\f[
   H_{\rm f}  = 
   \int \! d{\bf r} \; \left \{
   - \sum_{\alpha=1}^{M-1}  
     \frac{M \Omega_{\alpha}^{2} }{ 2 v \lambda_{\alpha}}
   - i \omega_{+}({\bf r}) c_{0} 
   + \chi/4 \right \}  
\f]
\f[
   H_{\rm c}  = 
   \int \! d{\bf r} \; 
   [ \omega_{-}({\bf r}) C_{-}({\bf r}) 
     + i \omega_{+}({\bf r}) C_{+}({\bf r}) 
   \quad.  
\f]
for \f$ \alpha = M \f$.
Note that \f$ H_{\rm f} \f$ depends only on the auxiliary fields 
(so that the subscript f denotes "field"), while \f$ H_{\rm c} \f$ 
introduces a coupling between auxiliary fields and the monomer 
concentrations (so that the subscript c denotes "concentration" or 
"coupling").  The energy \f$ H_{\rm c} \f$ can also be expressed as 
an external field energy
\f[
   H_{\rm c}  = 
   \int \! d{\bf r} \; 
   \left [ w_{1}({\bf r}) c_{1}({\bf r}) 
     + w_{2}({\bf r}) C_{2}({\bf r}) \right ]
   \quad,
\f]
in which each monomer of type \f$ i \f$ is subjected to a
complex-valued potential field \f$ w_{i} ({\bf r}) \f$, where
\f[
   w_{1}({\bf r}) = +\omega_{-}({\bf r}) + i\omega_{+}({\bf r}) \;
\f]
\f[
   w_{2}({\bf r}) = -\omega_{-}({\bf r}) + i\omega_{+}({\bf r}) .
\f]
for \f$ i = \f$ 1 and 2. 

<b> Field-Theoretic Hamiltonian  </b>

The expression for \f$ Z \f$ obtained above can be summarized as a 
functional integral of the form
\f[
   Z = N^{-1} 
   \int {\cal D}\omega \; e^{-H[\omega]}
   \quad,
\f]
in which 
\f[
   H  = -\ln Z_{\rm id} + H_{\rm f} \quad.
\f]
is a field theoretic Hamiltonian that is a functional of the fields 
\f$\omega_{-}\f$ and \f$\omega_{+}\f$, in which
\f[
   Z_{\rm id}[w]
   = \int \! {\cal D}{\bf r} \; e^{-U_{\rm id} - H_{\rm c}}
\f]
is the partition function for a hypothetical gas of non-interacting 
molecules subjected to fluctuating external fields, in which monomers 
of type \f$ i \f$ are subjected to field \f$ w_{i}({\bf r}) \f$.

\section psfts_theory_general_sec Field Theory: General (\f$ M \geq 2 \f$)

The implementation of PS-FTS in PSCF uses a ``symmetric" formulation of 
field theory for incompressible systems that allows treatment of systems
 with more than two monomer types (\f$ M > 2 \f$), subject to some 
constraints, but that reduces to the formalism described above when 
applied to a standard AB system.

<b> Matrix Notation </b>

Throughout the following discussion of this formulation, we use bold-faced
symbols to denote column vectors and matrices in which column and indices 
are associated with monomer types. Specifically, let 
\f$ {\bf c}({\bf r}) \f$ denotes the column vector with elements given by 
the monomer concentrations \f$ c_{1}({\bf r}), \ldots, c_{M}({\bf r}) \f$ 
at position \f$ {\bf r} \f$ .  Let \f$ {\boldsymbol \chi} \f$ denote the 
symmetric \f$ M \times M \f$ matrix of Flory-Huggins interaction 
parameters.

The incompressibility constraint can be expressed in matrix notation as
a requirement that 
\f[
   {\bf e}^{T} {\bf c}({\bf r}) = c_{0} \quad,
\f]
in which
\f[
  {\bf e} = \left [ \begin{array}{c}
            1 \\ 1 \\ \vdots \\ 1
            \end{array} \right ]
\f]
is an \f$ M \f$-component column vector with equal components 
\f$ e_{i}=1 \f$ for all \f$ i = 1, \cdots, M \f$. Here and hereafter,
a superscript \f$ T \f$ denotes a matrix transpose, so that 
\f$ {\bf e}^{T} = [1 \ldots 1] \f$ is a corresponding row vector.
Fluctuations of \f$ {\bf c}({\bf r})\f$ within the subspace orthogonal 
to \f$ {\bf e} \f$ thus preserve the incompressibility constraint. 

The formulation of PS-FTS in PSCF is based on a a de-composition of 
\f$ {\bf c}({\bf r}) \f$ and other vectors into components parallel and 
orthogonal to \f$ {\bf e} \f$.  Let \f$ {\bf Q} \f$ and \f$ {\bf P} \f$ 
denote \f$ M \times M \f$ orthogonal projection matrices
\f[
   {\bf Q} = \frac{1}{M}{\bf e}{\bf e}^{T}
   \quad\quad, \quad\quad
   {\bf P} = {\bf I} - {\bf Q}
   \quad, 
\f]
where \f$ {\bf I} \f$ is the \f$ M \times M \f$ identity matrix. 
Note that \f$ {\bf Q}{\bf e} = {\bf e} \f$, \f$ {\bf P}{\bf e} = 0 \f$,
and \f$ {\bf Q}{\bf P} = {\bf P}{\bf Q} = 0 \f$.
Multiplying a column vector by \f$ {\bf Q} \f$ yields its orthogonal
projection onto \f$ {\bf e} \f$, while multiplying such a vector by 
\f$ {\bf P} \f$ yields its projection into the \f$ M-1 \f$ dimensional 
subspace orthogonal to \f$ {\bf e} \f$ .  

<b> Projected \f$ \chi \f$ Matrix </b>

Let \f$ \tilde{\boldsymbol\chi} \f$ denote a symmetric \f$ M \times M \f$ 
matrix defined by the matrix product
\f[
   \tilde{\boldsymbol \chi} 
   \equiv {\bf P}{\boldsymbol \chi}{\bf P} \quad,
   \quad.
\f]
We refer to this as the projected \f$ \chi \f$ matrix. 
Let \f$ \tilde{\chi}_{ij} \f$ denote the element in row i and 
column j of matrix \f$ \tilde{\boldsymbol \chi} \f$ . 
Note that \f$ \tilde{\boldsymbol{\chi}} {\bf e} = 0\f$, implying 
that \f$ \tilde{\boldsymbol{\chi}} \f$ is a singular matrix for 
which \f$ {\bf e} \f$ is an eigenvector associated with a zero 
eigenvalue.

Let \f$ {\bf v}_{1}, \ldots, {\bf v}_{M} \f$ denote \f$ M \f$ orthogonal
eigenvectors of the symmetric matrix \f$ \tilde{\boldsymbol \chi} \f$, 
and let \f$ \lambda_{1}, \ldots, \lambda_{M} \f$ be the corresponding 
real eigenvalues,  defined such that
\f[
   \tilde{\boldsymbol\chi} {\bf v}_{\alpha} = 
   \lambda_{\alpha} {\bf v}_{\alpha}
\f]
for all \f$ \alpha = 1, \ldots, M \f$ .
As already noted, \f$ {\bf e} \f$ is always an eigenvector with a zero 
eigenvalue. By convention, we define this to be the last eigenvector,
so that 
\f[
   {\bf v}_{M} = {\bf e} \quad,
\f] 
giving \f$ \lambda_{M}=0 \f$. We also choose a normalization convention
for the eigenvectors in which
\f[
   {\bf v}_{\alpha}^{T} {\bf v}_{\beta} 
   = \delta_{\alpha\beta}M  
\f]
for all \f$ \alpha, \beta = 1,\ldots, M \f$ .
This convention is chosen to be compatible with the norm of 
\f$ {\bf e} = {\bf v}_{M} \f$, for which \f$ {\bf e}^{T}{\bf e} = M \f$,
and thus with the identification \f$ {\bf v}_{M} = {\bf e} \f$. 
Because eigenvectors of a real symmetric matrix with distinct eigenvalues
must be orthogonal, the \f$ M - 1 \f$ eigenvectors 
\f$ {\bf v}_{1}, \ldots, {\bf v}_{M-1} \f$ with generally nonzero 
eigenvalues are all orthogonal to \f$ {\bf e} \f$, and thus span the 
\f$ M - 1 \f$ dimensional subspace orthogonal to \f$ {\bf e} \f$ .

Let \f$ C_{\alpha}({\bf r}) \f$ denote a component of the vector
\f$ {\bf c}({\bf r}) \f$ in a basis of these eigenvectors, defined such 
that
\f[
   {\bf c}({\bf r}) = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{\alpha = 1}^{M}
   C_{\alpha}({\bf r}) {\bf v}_{\alpha}
   \quad\quad
   C_{\alpha}({\bf r}) = 
   {\bf v}^{T}_{\alpha} {\bf c}({\bf r}) 
\f]
for all \f$ \alpha = 1, \ldots, M \f$ .
Here and hereafter, we use lower case Greek letters \f$ \alpha, \beta \f$ 
for eigenvector indices and small Latin letters \f$ i, j, \ldots \f$ for 
monomer type indices, and use the Einstein summation convention and/or 
matrix multiplication only to represent sums over repeated monomer type 
indices.
Note that, because \f$ {\bf v}_{M} = {\bf e} \f$, the constraint requires
that \f$ C_{M}({\bf r}) = c_{0}\f$ for all \f$ {\bf r} \f$.
By substituting the expansion of \f$ {\bf c} \f$ in eigenvectors of the 
projected \f$ \chi \f$ matrix into the definition of \f$ U_{\rm int} \f$, 
while setting \f$ C_{M}({\bf r}) = c_{0} \f$ and noting that 
\f$ {\bf P}{\bf v}_{\alpha} = {\bf v}_{\alpha} \f$ for all 
\f$ \alpha = 1, \ldots, M - 1 \f$, it is straightforward to show that
\f[
   U_{\rm int} = 
   \sum_{\alpha=1}^{M-1} 
   \int d{\bf r} \;  \left \{
   \frac{v \lambda_{\alpha} }{2M} C_{\alpha}^{2} ({\bf r})
   + S_{\alpha} C_{\alpha}({\bf r})  
   \right \}
   + \frac{V}{2v} S_{M} 
\f]
where \f$ V \f$ is total system volume, and where we have defined
\f[
   S_{\alpha} \equiv 
   \frac{1}{M^2} {\bf v}_{\alpha}^{T} {\boldsymbol \chi} {\bf e}
\f]
for all \f$ \alpha = 1, \ldots, M \f$.

Field components associated with positive or negative eigenvalues 
must be treated differently when constructing a functional integral 
representation of \f$ Z \f$ .  
For each \f$ \alpha = 1, \ldots, M - 1\f$, let 
\f[
   \lambda_{\alpha}  = - \sigma_{\alpha}^{2} |\lambda_{\alpha}|
   \quad, 
\f]
with \f$ \sigma_{\alpha} = 1 \f$ for all \f$ \lambda_{\alpha} < 0 \f$ 
and \f$ \sigma_{\alpha} = i \f$ for \f$ \lambda_{\alpha} > 0 \f$.
By convention, we also define \f$ \sigma_{M} = i \f$ .

Let \f$ L \f$ denote the number of negative eigenvalues of 
\f$ \tilde{\boldsymbol \chi} \f$ . By convention, for systems with 
\f$ 0< L < M - 1 \f$, we take the first \f$ L \f$ eigenvalues 
\f$ \lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_{L} \f$ to be negative and take 
eigenvalues \f$ L+1, \ldots, M - 1 \f$ to be non-negative, while 
\f$ \lambda_{M} = 0 \f$ .

<b> Particle-Field Transformation </b>

A Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation may used to transform the
Boltzmann factor \f$ \exp( -U_{\rm int} ) \f$ given above into an 
a functional integral over \f$ M - 1 \f$ real-valued auxiliary 
fields \f$ \omega_{1}({\bf r}), \ldots, \omega_{M-1}({\bf r}) \f$, 
of the form
\f[
   e^{-U_{\rm int} }
   =  \frac{1}{N} 
   \int {\cal D}\omega' 
   \exp \left \{ - \sum_{\alpha=1}^{M-1} 
   \int \! d{\bf r} \; \left [  
    \frac{ M \omega_{\alpha}^{2}}{ 2 v |\lambda_{\alpha}| }
          + \sigma_{\alpha} \omega_{\alpha} C_{\alpha} 
          + S_{\alpha} C_{\alpha}
   \right ] \right \}
   \; , 
\f]
where \f$ \int {\cal D} \omega' \f$ denotes a functional integral over 
the \f$ M-1 \f$ auxiliary fields \f$ \omega_{1}, \ldots, \omega_{M-1} \f$, 
and where
\f[
   N \equiv
   \int {\cal D}\omega'
   \exp \left \{  -
   \sum_{\alpha=1}^{M-1} 
   \int \! d{\bf r} \; 
   \frac{M \omega_{\alpha}^{2}}{ 2 v |\lambda_{\alpha}| }  
   \right \} 
\f]
is a constant.  

The \f$ \delta \f$-function that constrains the total monomer 
concentration may also be expressed as a functional integral
\f[
   \delta(c({\bf r}) - c_{0}) = 
   \int {\cal D}\omega_{M} \exp \left \{ 
   - i \int d{\bf r} \; \omega_{M} [ \; C_{M} - c_{0} \; ]
   \right \} 
\f]
in which \f$ \omega_{M}({\bf r}) \f$ is a fluctuating Lagrange multplier 
field that imposes the constraint requiring that 
\f$ C_{M}({\bf r}) = c_{0} \f$, for all \f$ {\bf r} \f$, and 
\f$ \int {\cal D}\omega_{M} \f$ is a functional integral over this field.

Substituting the field-theoretic expressions for \f$ e^{-U_{\rm int}} \f$ 
and the \f$ \delta \f$-function into the definition of the \f$ Z \f$ for
an incompressible system, we obtain
\f[
   Z = N^{-1} 
   \int {\cal D}\omega \; e^{ -H_{\rm f} }
   \int \! {\cal D}{\bf r} \; e^{-U_{\rm id} - H_{\rm c}}
   \quad,
\f]
in which \f$ \int {\cal D}\omega \f$ denotes an integral over all 
\f$ M \f$ real fields \f$ \omega_{1}, \ldots, \omega_{M} \f$ (including 
the Lagrange multiplier field \f$ \omega_{M} \f$ ), and
\f[
   H_{\rm f}  = 
   \int \! d{\bf r} \; \left \{
   - \sum_{\alpha=1}^{M-1}  
     \frac{M \Omega_{\alpha}^{2} }{ 2 v \lambda_{\alpha}}
   - \Omega_{M}c_{0} \right \}  + U_{\rm int}^{(0)} \quad
\f]
\f[
   H_{\rm c}  = 
   \sum_{\alpha=1}^{M} 
   \int \! d{\bf r} \; 
    W_{\alpha} ({\bf r}) C_{\alpha}({\bf r})
   \quad.  
\f]
The fields \f$ W_{1}, \ldots, W_{M} \f$ used to define \f$ H_{\rm c} \f$ are
given by
\f[
   W_{\alpha}({\bf r}) \equiv
   + \sigma_{\alpha} \omega_{\alpha}({\bf r}) 
   + S_{\alpha} 
\f]
for all \f$ \alpha = 1, \ldots, M - 1 \f$ and
\f[
   W_{M}({\bf r}) \equiv i\omega_{M}({\bf r}) 
   \quad, 
\f]
for \f$ \alpha = M \f$.
Note that Hamiltonian component \f$ H_{\rm f} \f$ depends only on 
the auxiliary fields (so that the subscript f denotes "field"),
while component \f$ H_{\rm c} \f$ introduces a coupling between 
auxiliary fields and the monomer concentrations (so that the 
subscript c denotes "concentration" or "coupling").

The energy \f$ H_{\rm c} \f$ can also be expressed as a sum 
\f[
   H_{\rm c}  = 
   \sum_{i=1}^{M} \int \! d{\bf r} \; 
   w_{i}({\bf r})c_{i}({\bf r})  
   \quad,
\f]
in which \f$ w_{1}({\bf r}), \ldots w_{M}({\bf r}) \f$ denote 
potential fields associated with specific monomer types, given by
\f[
   w_{i}({\bf r}) = 
   \sum_{\alpha=1}^{M} W_{\alpha}({\bf r}) v_{\alpha i} 
   \quad \quad
   W_{\alpha}({\bf r}) = 
   \frac{1}{M} \sum_{j=1}^{M} v_{\alpha j} w_{j}({\bf r}) 
\f]
for all \f$ i = 1, \ldots, M \f$ and \f$ \alpha = 1, \ldots, M \f$ .
The fields \f$ w_{1}, \ldots, w_{M} \f$ are the monomer chemical 
potential fields used within the solution of the modified diffusion 
equation to compute single-polymer partition functions for chains
in an external field. 

<b> Field-Theoretic Hamiltonian  </b>

The functional integral expression for \f$ Z \f$ obtained above
may expressed as an integral
\f[
  Z = N^{-1} \int {\cal D}\omega \; e^{-H[\omega]}
\f]
in which 
\f[
  H = H_{\rm f} - \ln Z_{\rm id}
\f]
is an effective Hamiltonian, and
\f[
  Z_{\rm id}[w] = 
  \int {\cal D}{\bf r} \; e^{-U_{\rm id} - H_{\rm c} } \\
\f]
is the partition function of a hypothetical gas of non-interacting 
molecules in which monomers of type \f$ i \f$ are subjected to a 
field \f$ w_{i}({\bf r}) \f$ . The result is a straightforward 
generalization of that obtained for standard AB systems, after
generalizing the definition of both \f$ H_{\rm f} \f$ and 
\f$ H_{\rm c} \f$.
