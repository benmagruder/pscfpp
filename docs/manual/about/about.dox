\section about_pscf_sec About PSCF

PSCF is a package of software for solving the Edwards-Helfand
self-consistent theory for polymer liquids. The version presented here is
written primarily in C++, with some CUDA code for programs that can run
on Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs).
The source code for PSCF is maintained in the github repository
<a href=https://github.com/dmorse/pscfpp/>https://github.com/dmorse/pscfpp</a>.

This C++ version of PSCF is intended to supersede an older Fortran
program of the same name. The older Fortran PSCF program is maintained
in a separate github.com repository at
<a href= https://github.com/dmorse/pscf/>https://github.com/dmorse/pscf</a>
for details.
This new code currently provides almost all of the capabilities of the
older Fortran program, and some significant new capabilities, as discussed
below.

Differences between this C++ version of PSCF and the older Fortran
program and some expected advantages of the new code include:
<ul>
  <li>
  The new version is written as an extensible package that contains
  several different programs designed for use with different geometries,
  boundary conditions, algorithms or hardware, implemented within a
  common framework.
  </li>
  <li>
  The new code enables simulations of mixtures containing arbitrary
  acyclic branched copolymers, in addition to the linear block
  polymers and linear homopolymers allowed by the Fortran PSCF code.
  </li>
  <li>
  Adoption of C++ as a base language has simplified implementation
  of a variant that that uses graphical process units (GPUs).
  </li>
</ul>

\section about_programs_sec Programs

Currently, the package contains the following set of programs:

   - <b> pscf_fd </b> : A one-dimensional finite difference program.

   - <b> pscf_pc </b>: CPU programs for periodic structures that are periodic
     in 1, 2, or 3 coordinates.

   - <b> pscf_pg </b>: GPU accelerated programs for period microstructures in
     1, 2 or 3 dimensions.

Comments:

<b> pscf_pd </b>: The one-dimensional finite difference program is designed
treat problems in which the solutions vary with only one spatial coordinate,
which can be either a Cartesian coordinate or the radial coordinate for a
problem with cylindrical or spherical symmetry. This is useful for treating
problems involving flat or curved interfaces, as well as cylindrical and
spherical copolymer micelles. The executable for this program is named
pscf_fd. The suffix "fd" stands for "finite difference".

<b> pscf_pc </b>:
The pseudo-spectral CPU programs for periodic microstructures are closely
analogous to the older PSCF Fortran program, and provide similar capabilties
and performance.  Different executable programs are used to solve problems
that are period in 1, 2 or 3 spatial dimensions, which are named pscf_pc1,
pscf_pc2 and pscf_pc3, respectively. Here, "pc" stands for "periodic CPU".

<b> pscf_pg </b>:
The GPU-accelerated programs for periodic structures are closely analogous
to the corresponding CPU programs, and provide almost identical capabilities,
at higher speed.  The GPU accelerated programs for solving 1, 2 and 3
dimensionally periodic structures are named pscf_pg1, pscf_pg2 and pscf_pg3,
respectively, where "pg" stands for "periodic GPU".

\section about_features_sec Features

All PSCF programs are designed to treat an incompressible mixture of
block polymers, linear homopolymers and small molecule (point-particle)
solvents species. All polymeric species are treated using the standard
Gaussian model of a polymer as a continuous random walk.

Features that are common to all of the PSCF programs include:

  - Mixtures of any number of block polymers, homopolymers, and solvent species

  - Arbitrarily complex linear or acyclic branched block polymers

  - Canonical, grand-canonical or mixed statistical ensembles -
    Users may specify either a volume fraction or a chemical potential
    for each species

  - Efficient simulation of sequences of parameter choices along a path 
    in parameter space by continuation of solutions ("sweep" functionality)

  - Examples of converged solutions and input scripts

  - Thorough user and developer documentation

  - Open source code

Features specific to programs for periodic structures include:

  - Ordered phases with 1, 2 or 3 dimensional periodicity

  - All possible 2D and 3D lattice systems (i.e., orthorhombic, monoclinic,
    etc.).

  - Automatic optimization of unit parameters so so as to minimize 
    free energy

  - Imposition of any user-selected space-group symmetry

  - Built-in "database" of all 230 3D space groups and 17 2D plane groups

  - High accuracy pseudo-spectral solution of the modified diffusion 
    equation

  - Efficient Anderson-mixing iteration algorithm

\section about_repo_sec Cloning the Source Code

The source code may be obtained by using a git version control system
client to clone the github source code repository. To do so on a machine
with a git client installed, enter the command:
\code
git clone --recursive https://github.com/dmorse/pscfpp.git
\endcode
Note the use of the --recursive option to the git clone command. This
is necessary to clone several git submodules that are maintained in
separate repositories. This command will create a new directory called
pscfpp/ that contains all of the source code and associated
documentation, including all required git submodules.

\section about_documentation_sec Documentation

Documentation is provides as an html web manual that contains both
user and developer documentation. An online copy of the documentation 
of a recent major release is available online at 
<a ref=https://dmorse.github.io/pscfpp-man/>
https://dmorse.github.io/pscfpp-man </a>.

The PSCF repository contains all of the source files from which the 
web manual is generated. This makes it possible for users to generate 
a local copy of the manual on their own computer. The web manual is 
created using the doxygen documentation utility. In order to generate 
the documentation, doxygen must be installed on your computer, and 
the directory containing the doxygen executable must be in your unix
command search PATH.

To generate documentation, change directory (cd) to the pscfpp/ root
directory and then enter
\code
   > make html
\endcode
This should create many html files in the pscfpp/docs/html directory.
To begin reading the documentation, point a browser at the file
pscfpp/docs/html/index.html, which contains the main page of the
web manual.

\section about_dependencies_sec Dependencies

The PSCF source code is written using C++ as the primary language, with
CUDA used in some programs for GPU acceleration. PSCF is only provided
in source file format - all programs must be compiled from source.
This package was developed on linux and and Mac OS X operating systems
using standard unix utilities, and is designed to run on these or other
unix-like systems.

To compile and run this or other unix software on Mac OS X, you must
first install the unix command line tools. These tools are provided as
part of the much larger XCode Mac development environment, but can also
be installed separately.

The CPU-based programs within the PSCF package depend on the following
external libraries:

  - Gnu scientific library (GSL)

  - FFTW fast Fourier transform library

The one-dimensional finite difference program pscf_fd requires only GSL,
and not FFTW. The pscf_pc CPU-based programs for spatially periodic
structures require both GSL and FFTW.

The GPU-accelerated pscf_pg programs can only run on a computer with an
appropriate NVIDIA GPU. To compile or run these programs, the system must
also have an NVIDIA CUDA development environment that provides the CUFFT
fast Fourier transform library.

Procedures for installing these dependencies are different for
different operating system environments and different package managers.
Instructions for some common environments are given in the web manual.

Complete directions for compiling and installing PSCF are provided in
\ref install_page "section 2" of this manual.
