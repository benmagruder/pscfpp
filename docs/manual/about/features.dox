Features that are common to all three PSCF programs and that are 
applicable to both SCFT and FTS calculations include:

  - Ability to treat mixtures containing any number of block polymer 
    and solvent molecular species. Linear homopolymers are treated 
    as special case of block polymers with only one block

  - Ability to treat acyclic branched block polymers of arbitrary
    complexity, as well as linear block polymers

  - Ability to use canonical, grand-canonical or mixed statistical
    ensembles - users specify either a volume fraction or a chemical
    potential value for each molecular species

  - Thorough user and developer documentation is provided via an 
    integrated web manual

  - Well documented open source code written in object oriented C++

  - A library of examples of input files for many types of calculation

  - Python tools for data analysis and manipulation of input files

Features for SCFT calculations that are common to all PSCF programs
include:

  - Efficient Anderson-mixing SCFT iteration algorithms

  - Efficient SCFT calculations for sequences of parameter choices along
    a path in parameter space ("sweeps"), using extrapolation to construct
    initial guesses

The pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs provide very similar features and 
are both designed to perform either SCFT calculations or FTS calculations 
that use a partial saddle-point approximation 
for systems with periodic boundary conditions. In SCFT calculations of
a periodic ordered phase, the periodic simulation unit cell is usually
used to represent a single crystallographic unit cell of the ordered 
structure. In FTS simulations, the simulation unit cell is often taken
to represent a larger region that, in an ordered phase, may contain 
multiple crystallographic unit cells.  

Features of the pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs that are relevant to both 
SCFT and FTS calculations include:

  - Accurate pseudo-spectral solution of the modified diffusion equation
    using an algorithm that is accurate to 4th order in the contour
    length step size

  - Periodic unit cells with 1, 2 or 3 dimensional periodicity

  - Unit cells with all possible 2D and 3D Bravais lattice systems 
    (i.e., cubic, orthorhombic, monoclinic, etc.) 

  - A companion matlab package
    [Polymer Visual](<https://github.com/kdorfmanUMN/polymer_visual/>)
    for visualization of structures

Features for SCFT calculations that are common to the pscf_pc and pscf_pg 
programs include:

  - Efficient algorithms to optimize unit cell parameters in SCFT so
    as to minimize free energy density

  - Imposition of any user-selected space-group symmetry on SCFT solutions

  - Built-in database of symmetry operations for all 230 3D space groups
    and 17 2D plane groups for use in SCFT

Features for SCFT calculations performed with the pscf_pc CPU program
that have not yet been ported to pscf_pg are:

  - Inhomogeneous density constraints (a "mask")

  - External fields

  - Thin polymer films

The mask and external field features are used in pscf_pc to implement
simulations of thin films. A mask is used to constrain a polymer material
to a slit within a periodic supercell, and localized external fields are
used to represent selective interactions with the top and bottom
surfaces.
