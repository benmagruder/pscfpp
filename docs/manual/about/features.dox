* **Common features for SCFT and FTS (all programs):**

  - Ability to treat mixtures containing any number of block polymer 
    and solvent molecular species. Linear homopolymers are treated 
    as special case of block polymers with only one block

  - Ability to treat acyclic branched block polymers of arbitrary
    complexity, as well as linear block polymers

  - Ability to use canonical, grand-canonical or mixed statistical
    ensembles - users specify either a volume fraction or a chemical
    potential value for each molecular species

  - Thorough user and developer documentation is provided via an 
    integrated web manual

  - Well documented open source code written in object oriented C++

  - A library of examples of input files for many types of calculation

  - Python tools for data analysis and manipulation of input files

* **Features for SCFT (all programs):**

  - Efficient Anderson-mixing SCFT iteration algorithms

  - Efficient SCFT calculations for sequences of parameter choices along
    a path in parameter space ("sweeps"), using extrapolation to construct
    initial guesses

The pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs are designed for systems with periodic
boundary conditions and provide very similar feature sets. Both of these
programs can perform either SCFT calculations or FTS calculations that 
rely on a partial saddle-point approximation. In SCFT calculations of
a periodic ordered phase, the periodic simulation unit cell is usually
used to represent a single crystallographic unit cell of the ordered 
structure. In FTS simulations, the simulation unit cell is usually taken
to represent a larger region that, for simulations of ordered phases, may 
contain multiple crystallographic unit cells.  

* **Features for SCFT or FTS on periodic systems (pscf_pc and pscf_pg):**

  - Accurate pseudo-spectral solution of the modified diffusion equation
    using an algorithm that is accurate to 4th order in the contour
    length step size

  - Periodic unit cells with 1, 2 or 3 dimensional periodicity

  - Unit cells with all possible 2D and 3D Bravais lattice systems 
    (i.e., cubic, orthorhombic, monoclinic, etc.) 

  - A companion matlab package
    [Polymer Visual](<https://github.com/kdorfmanUMN/polymer_visual/>)
    for visualization of periodic structures

* **Features for SCFT on periodic systems (pscf_pc and pscf_pg):**

  - Efficient algorithms to optimize unit cell parameters in SCFT so as
    to minimize free energy density

  - Imposition of any user-selected space-group symmetry on SCFT solutions

  - Built-in database of symmetry operations for all 230 3D space groups
    and 17 2D plane groups for use in SCFT

* **Features for FTS with periodic boundary conditions(pscf_pc and pscf_pg):**

  - Implementation of both Monte Carlo (MC) and Brownian dynamics (BD) 
    sampling algorithms, 

  - Several efficient algorithms for adjusting the pressure field so as
    to find a partial saddle-point (i.e., to impose incompressibility).

  - MC moves: real-space, Fourier-space, and "smart"/force-bias moves 

  - BD algorithms: predictor corrector and Leimkuhler-Matthews steppers

* **SCFT features unique to pscf_pc:**

  - Inhomogeneous density constraints (a "mask")

  - External fields

  - Thin polymer films

The mask and external field features are used in pscf_pc to implement
simulations of thin films. A mask is used to constrain a polymer material
to a slit within a periodic supercell, and localized external fields are
used to represent selective interactions with the top and bottom
surfaces.
