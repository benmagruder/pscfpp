PSCF is a package of several programs that are designed to predict 
equilibrium properties of inhomogeneous states in polymer liquids. 
All PSCF programs currently use a standard coarse-grained model that 
treat polymer conformations as continuous random walks, and that treats 
the material as rigorously incompressible. Systems modeled by PSCF may 
be either one-component block polymer melts or mixtures that contains 
one or more block polymer or homopolymers species.  Such a mixture 
may also contain zero or more small molecule solvent species that are 
treated as pointlike particles.  Polymeric species may be linear or 
have any user-specified acyclic branched structure.  All molecular
species in a system are constructed from a list of available monomer
types, in which each monomer is assigned a statistical segment length. 
Interactions among different types of monomer are described by binary 
Flory-Huggins interaction parameters.

PSCF is designed primarily to predict structures and free energies 
of inhomogeneous equilibrium states of polymer liquids in which 
inhomogeneity is driven a tendency of different types of monomer to 
phase separate.  The current version of PSCF (v1.2) can be used to 
perform either self-consistent field theory calculations or stochastic 
field-theoretic simulations that rely on a partial-saddle point
approximation, as discussed below. 

\section about_methods_scft_sec Self-consistent field theory

Self-consistent field theory (SCFT) is a form of mean field theory for
polymeric liquids. In SCFT, conformational statistics of individual 
polymers are approximated by the solution of an auxiliary single-polymer
problem in which each molecule is acted upon by a set of monomer chemical
potential fields (referred to in PSCF documentation as w fields) that
represent average effects of interactions with other molecules. The
behavior of a single polymer in a specified set of w fields is described
by the solution of a modified diffusion equation (MDE), which is a linear
partial differential equation (PDE) that describes the conformational
statistics of a random walk polymer in an inhomogeneous environment.
Solutions of the MDE can be used to compute average concentrations for 
monomers of each type as functions of position, yielding monomer
concentration fields that are referred to in the PSCF documentation 
as "c fields". The solution of an SCFT problem must satisfy a set of 
nonlinear self-consistent field (SCF) equations that require that the 
w and c fields be related by an empirical description of the 
thermodynamics of mixing for the chosen set of monomer types.

We recommend the following references as introductions to the SCFT of
inhomogeneous polymer liquids:

The reference by Arora et al. is particularly appropriate as an 
introduction to the implementation of SCFT in PSCF because it was written,
in part, as a description of the earlier Fortran version of PSCF, and so
uses conventions and working equations consistent with those used 
throughout the PSCF documentation and source code.

\section about_methods_fts_sec Field-theoretic simulation

Field-theoretic simulation (FTS) methods are a family of closely related
stochastic simulation methods that sample an equilibrium ensemble of
possible configurations of fluctuating chemical potential fields
("w fields"), rather than solving for a single field configuration as
in SCFT.  The theory underlying these methods is based upon a 
mathematically exact transformation of the partition function for a system 
of interacting particles from an integral over particle positions into a
functional integral over configurations of a set of fluctuating 
auxiliary fields.  There are two distinct classes of FTS methods, which 
are discussed separately below:

<b> Fully Fluctuating Field Theoretic Simulations (FF-FTS): </b>

An exact formulation of the particle-to-field transformation leads
to an expression for the partition function as a functional integral
in which the fields and the integrand of the functional integral are 
complex-valued rather than real-valued quantities. The complex Langevin 
sampling method, which is not yet implemented in PSCF, is designed to 
sample the resulting complex functional integral. Complex Langevin 
simulations of this "fully fluctuating" field theory are believed to 
yield results that are statistically equivalent to those obtained 
from simulations of a corresponding particle based model.

The following references discuss the transformation of the partition
function into a functional integral, and the formulation of various
types of "fully fluctuating" field thoeretic simulations (FF-FTS) that 
are based directly on the resulting formulation:

    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/ma011515t">
    "Field-theoretic computer simulations methods for polymers and
    complex fluids," </a> *Macromolecules* **2002**, <i>35</i>, 16-39.

    of Polymer Melts and Solutions", </a>
    *J. Phys. Chem. B* **2016**, <i>120</i> 7615.

The current version PSCF does not provide code for complex Langevin 
FF-FTS.

<b> Partial-Saddle Point Field Theoretic Simulations (PS-FTS): </b>

FTS methods that are implemented in v1.2 of PSCF are instead all based
on a so-called "partial saddle point" approximation to the fully
fluctuating field theory. This is an approximation in which a field
component component that enforces the incompressibility constraint,
sometimes referred to as a "pressure" field, is treated at a
self-consistent field level, while the other field component or components
are allowed to fluctuate. The use of a self-consistent field approximation
for the pressure field is mathematically equivalent to approximating this 
field by its value at a partial saddle-point, which is a field 
configuration in which the partial functional derivative of the field
theoretic Hamiltonian with respect to this field vanishes. We refer 
to field theoretic simulations based on this approximation as 
partial saddle-point field theoretic simulations (PS-FTS).

When the partial saddle-point approximation is applicable, it leads to
an expression for the partition function as a functional integral in 
which all of quantities of interest have real (rather than complex)
values. Simulations that rely on the partial-saddle point approximation
also seem thus far to be substantially more efficient than complex
Langevin simulations, at a modest cost in accuracy. PSCF v1.2 implements
several Monte-Carlo and Brownian dynamics algorithms for sampling the 
ensemble defined by the partial saddle-point approximation.

The PS-FTS method cannot be applied to as wide a range of different 
types of systems as the complex Langevin FF-FTS.  It has thus far
been applied in published work only to systems with only two monomer 
types (AB systems) with a positive Flory-Huggins interaction parameter. 
The implemention of partial-saddle point approximation that is 
currently used in PSCF allows application to a somewhat wider range 
of systems, including some systems with three monomer types, but also 
requires imposes some constraints on the allowed values of interaction 
parameters.

The following reference provides a good overview of simulations based 
on the partial saddle-point approximation up to 2021, with references to
earlier work:

    Partial Saddle-Point Approximation", </a>
