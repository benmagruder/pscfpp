For any PSCF simulation program, the parameter file is read first,
followed by a command script. The command file controls the sequence
of operations performed after the program is initialized using 
information from the parameter file.  The name of the command file 
is specified when the program is invoked as an argument of the -c 
command line option.

The command file contains a sequence of commands that are read and 
executed in sequence. Each command begins with an all upper case label. 
Some commands take one or more parameters, which must appear after the 
upper case label, separated by whitespace. The program stops execution 
and returns control to the operating system when it encounters the 
command string 'FINISH' on a line by itself.
