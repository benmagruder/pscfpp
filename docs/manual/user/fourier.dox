This page describes the different numerical representations used in
the pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs describe fields (functions of position)
with the periodicity of a Bravais lattice. We will also consider a
symmetry-adapted Fourier expansion appropriate for periodic fields
that are also known to be invariant under all symmetry operations
of a specified space group.  Throughout these notes, let \f$ D \f$
denote the number of directions in which the field of interest are
taken to be periodic, which is the dimensionality of the space in
which these fields are defined. Allowed values of \f$ D \f$ are
\f$ D = 1 \f$ for lamellar structures, \f$ D = 2 \f$ for structures
such as those involving two-dimensionally periodic arrangements of
cylinders (e.g., hexagonally packed cylinders), and \f$ D = 3 \f$
for crystals with full three-dimensional periodicity (e.g.,
arrangements of spheres and 3D network structures).

\section user_fourier_bravais_sec Bravais and Reciprocal Lattice

Consider a D-dimensional crystal with a Bravais lattice defined by
lattice basis vectors \f$ {\bf a}_{0}, \ldots, {\bf a}_{D-1} \f$.
The Bravais lattice is defined to be the infinite set containing
every vector \f$ {\bf R} \f$ that can be expressed as a sum
\f[
   {\bf R} = \sum_{\alpha=0}^{D-1} m_{\alpha} {\bf a}_{\alpha}
\f]
with arbitrary integer values of the indices \f$ m_{0},\ldots,m_{D-1} \f$.
A field \f$ f({\bf r}) \f$ is said to have the periodicity of this
lattice if it is  invariant under translation by any Bravais lattice
vector, i.e., if
\f[
  f({\bf r} + {\bf R}) = f({\bf r})
\f]
for any D-dimensional position vector \f$ {\bf r} \f$ and any
translation vector \f$ {\bf R} \f$ that belongs to the Bravais lattice.

Let vectors \f$ {\bf b}_{0}, \ldots, {\bf b}_{D-1} \f$ denote
\f$ D \f$ reciprocal lattice basis vectors that are defined such
that
\f[
  {\bf a}_{\alpha} \cdot {\bf b}_{\beta} = 2\pi \delta_{\alpha \beta}
\f]
for \f$ \alpha, \beta \in [0,..,D-1] \f$, where \f$ \delta_{\alpha \beta}\f$
is a Kronecker delta function. The reciprocal lattice associated with this
Bravais lattice is defined to be the infinite set containing every vector
\f$ {\bf } \f$ that can be expressed as a sum
\anchor user_fourier_Gofn_eqn
\f[
   {\bf G}(n_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1}) 
   = \sum_{\alpha=0}^{D-1} n_{\alpha} {\bf b}_{\alpha}
\f]
with integer values of \f$ n_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1} \f$.  In what follows, 
we will sometimes refer to the integer indices \f$ n_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1}\f$
that appear in this expansion of a reciprocal lattice vector as Miller
indices for that wavevector.

Any field with the periodicity of a Bravais lattice may be expanded as a 
Fourier series \anchor user_fourier_fourierR_eqn
\f[
  f({\bf r}) = \sum_{{\bf G}} \tilde{f}({\bf G})
  e^{i {\bf G} \cdot {\bf r}}
  \quad,
\f]
in which \f$ {\bf G} \f$ denotes a reciprocal lattice vector, the sum
is taken over the infinite set of all reciprocal lattice vectors, and
\f$ \tilde{f}({\bf G}) \f$ is a complex Fourier coefficient associated 
with reciprocal lattice vector \f$ {\bf G} \f$.  The Fourier coefficient
\f$ \tilde{f}({\bf G}) \f$ is equal to the value of the integral
\f[
  \tilde{f}({\bf G}) =  \frac{1}{V_{\rm cell}}
  \int\limits_{{\rm cell}} d^{D}r \;
  e^{-i {\bf G} \cdot {\bf r}} f({\bf r}) \quad,
\f]
in which the integral is a D-dimensional integral over one unit cell,
and \f$ V_{\rm cell} \f$ is the general volume of the unit cell (e.g.,
the length for D=1, area for D=2, or volume for D=3).

The general Fourier series given above can be used to expand either
real- or complex valued periodic functions of position. If \f$ f \f$
is a real-value function, then its Fourier coefficients must satisfies 
the condition
\f[
   \tilde{f}(-{\bf G}) = \tilde{f}^{*}({\bf G})
\f]
for any reciprocal lattice vector \f$ {\bf G} \f$. Here and hereafter,
we use \f$ C^{*} \f$ to denote the complex conjugate of any complex
number \f$ C \f$.  Note that this constraint requires that that
\f$ \tilde{f}({\bf G}) \f$ be real in the specal case
\f$ {\bf G} = 0 \f$.

\section user_fourier_reduced_sec Reduced Coordinates

It is convenient to introduce dimensionless reduced coordinates 
\f$ x_{0}, \ldots, x_{D-1} \f$ associated with any Cartesian position 
vector \f$ {\bf r} \f$ within a crystal, which are defined such that
\f[
   {\bf r}(x_0, \ldots, x_{D-1})
   = \sum_{\alpha = 0}^{D-1} {\bf a}_{\alpha} x_{\alpha}
  \quad.
\f]
The reduced coordinates are thus the components of \f$ {\bf r} \f$ 
in a basis of Bravais lattice basis vectors.  
The primary unit cell of a crystal is defined to be a region in 
which \f$ 0 \leq x_{\alpha} < 1 \f$ for all \f$ \alpha = 0, \ldots, D-1 \f$.
This corresponds to a unit domain in the space of reduced coordinates that
is give by the domain \f$ [0,1) \f$ for D=1, a unit square for D=2 or a 
unit cube for D=3.  This maps onto a unit cell in Cartesian coordinates 
that is a parallelogram for D=2 or a parallelopiped for D=3, and for 
which the vectors connecting neighboring corners are Bravais lattice 
basis vectors.

Suppose that \f$ f({\bf r}) \f$ is a periodic function of the
Cartesian position vector \f$ {\bf r} \f$ and that
\f$ F(x_{0}, \ldots, x_{D-1}) \f$ is an equivalent function of
the reduced coordinates \f$ x_{0}, \ldots, x_{D-1} \f$, defined
such that
\f[
 F(x_{0}, \ldots, x_{D-1}) =
 f({\bf r}(x_{0},\ldots,x_{D-1}))
\f]
for any list of reduced coordinates.
The requirement that a function \f$ f({\bf r})\f$ be periodic under
translations by Bravais lattice vector is equivalent to a requirement
that \f$ F \f$ be invariant under changes of any reduced coordinate
by addition of arbitrary integer.  That is, for any periodic function
\f$ F \f$ of the reduced coordinates,
\f[
   F(x_{0} + k_{0}, \ldots, x_{D-1} + k_{D-1} )
   = F(x_{0}, \ldots, x_{D-1} )
\f]
for arbitrary integer values of \f$ k_{0}, \ldots, k_{D-1} \f$.

Using the above expressions for \f$ {\bf r}(x_{0}, \ldots, x_{D-1}) \f$ and
\f$ {\bf G}(n_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1}) \f$ and the bi-orthogonality relation 
for Bravais and reciprocal basis vectors, it is straightforward to show 
that
\f[
   \exp \left (  i{\bf G} \cdot {\bf r} \right )
   = 
   \exp \left ( 2\pi i \sum_{\alpha = 0}^{D-1} n_{\alpha} x_{\alpha} \right )
\f]
for any choice of reciprocal lattice vector \f$ {\bf G}(n_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1}) \f$ 
and any position vector \f$ {\bf r}(x_{0}, \ldots, x_{D-1}) \f$.
Upon substituting this into the general Fourier series expansion for 
a periodic function \f$ f({\bf r})\f$ given 
\ref user_fourier_fourierR_eqn "above", we find that the corresponding
function \f$ F(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{D-1}) \f$ of the reduced coordinates may 
be expressed as an infinite series
\anchor user_fourier_fourierX_eqn
\f[
  F(x_{0}, \ldots, x_{D-1}) =
  \sum_{n_{0} = -\infty}^{\infty} \cdots
  \sum_{n_{D-1} = -\infty}^{\infty}
  \tilde{F}(n_{0},\ldots,n_{D-1})
  \exp \left ( 2\pi i \sum_{\alpha = 0}^{D-1} n_{\alpha} x_{\alpha} \right )
\f]
in which the sum is taken over all integer values of each of the Miller 
indices, and in which 
\f$ \tilde{F}(n_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1}) \f$ is a Fourier amplitude defined
such that
\f[
   \tilde{f}({\bf G}(n_{0},\ldots,n_{D-1}) \equiv
   \tilde{F}(n_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1})
\f]
for the wavevector \f$ {\bf G}(n_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1}) \f$.
This form for the expansion of a periodic function of the reduced coordinates
can also be justified as a special case of the general Fourier expansion 
applied to a function \f$ F(x_{0}, \ldots, x_{D-1}) \f$ which has the 
periodicity of a generalized cubic lattice with orthogonal Bravais lattice 
basis vectors of unit magnitude.

\section user_fourier_grid_sec Mesh Discretization 

All fields in the pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs are represented internally
using values of fields on a regular D-dimensional mesh in the space of the 
reduced coordinates \f$ x_{0}, \ldots, x_{D-1} \f$.
Let \f$ M_{\alpha} \f$ denote the number of mesh points per unit cell 
along direction \f$ \alpha \f$ for each integer direction index 
\f$ \alpha = 0, \ldots, D-1 \f$.
The values of \f$ M_{0}, \ldots, M_{D-1} \f$ are specified in the
paramter file for a pscf_pc or pscf_pg program as values for elements
of the parameter "mesh", whose value is a vector with integer-valued
elements.  Nodes on this mesh correspond to points at which each
coordinate \f$ x_{\alpha} \f$ with \f$ \alpha \in [0, \ldots, D-1]\f$
has a value given by
\f[
    x_{\alpha} = m_{\alpha}/M_{\alpha}
\f]
for some integer \f$ m_{\alpha} \in [0,\ldots,M_{\alpha}-1] \f$ for
nodes within the primary unit cell.

\section user_fourier_dft_sec Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)

Let \f$ F \f$ denote a function that is defined only on the nodes of such 
a regular grid, where \f$ F(m_{0}, \ldots, m_{D-1}) \f$ denotes the value of 
\f$ F \f$ on the grid node with integer indices 
\f$ m_{0}, \ldots, m_{D-1} \f$.

\subsection user_fourier_dft_forward_sub Forward DFT
Let \f$ \tilde{F} \f$ denote the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of
\f$ F \f$, which we define here by a sum
\anchor user_fourier_dftdef_eqn
\f[
  \tilde{F} (n_0, \ldots, n_{D-1}) =
  \frac{1}{M_{\rm tot}}
  \sum_{m_{0}=0}^{M_{0}-1} \cdots
  \sum_{m_{D-1}=0}^{M_{D-1}-1}
  F(m_{0},\ldots,m_{D-1})
  \exp \left (
  -2\pi i \sum_{\alpha = 0}^{D-1} n_{\alpha} m_{\alpha}/M_{\alpha}
  \right )
\f]
in which \f$ M_{\rm tot} \f$ denotes the total number of grid points
in the primary unit cell of the mesh, given by the product
\f[
   M_{\rm tot} = M_{0} \cdots M_{D-1} \quad.
\f]
of the numbers of grid points in each direction.

\subsection user_fourier_dft_alias_sub Wavevector Aliasing

The discrete Fourier transform \f$ \tilde{f} (n_0, \ldots, n_{D-1}) \f$ is
a function of \f$ D \f$ integer indices, and is thus itself defined on a
lattice in reciprocal space.  It is straightforward to show that the DFT
\f$ \tilde{F} \f$ defined above is itself a periodic function in reciprocal
 space, for which \f$ \tilde{F} \f$ is invariant under a shift of the
Miller index \f$ n_{\alpha} \f$ associated with direction \f$ \alpha \f$
by any multiple of the number of grid points \f$ M_{\alpha} \f$
along direction \f$ \alpha \f$. That is, for any DFT \f$ \tilde{F} \f$,
\f[
  \tilde{F}(n_{0} + k_{0}M_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1} + k_{D-1}M_{D-1}
  = \tilde{F}(n_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1})
\f]
for any choice of integers \f$ k_{0}, \ldots, k_{D=1} \f$.
To show this, we simply note that the effect of changing \f$ n_{\alpha}\f$
to \f$ n_{\alpha} + k_{\alpha} M_{\alpha} \f$ within the
\ref user_fourier_dftdef_eqn "sum" that defines \f$ \tilde{f} \f$ is
to shift the argument of the exponential by a corresponding integer
multiple \f$ m_{\alpha}k_{\alpha}2\pi i \f$ of \f$ 2\pi i \f$, which
has no effect on the value of the exponential.

This periodic property of discrete Fourier transforms is sometimes
referred to as "aliasing" of wavevectors. Any list of D Miller indices
\f$ n_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1} \f$ can be used to construct an associated
reciprocal lattice wavevector \f$ {\bf G}(n_0, \ldots, n_{D-1}) \f$ in 
which the Miller indices are components of the vector in a basis of 
reciprocal lattice basis vectors, as \anchor user_fourier_Gofn_eqn "above".
Two  lists of integer Miller indices are referred to as "aliases" of one 
another if these lists contain values for each index \f$ n_{i} \f$ that 
are either equal or differ by some nonzero integer multiple of the number 
\f$ N_{i} \f$ of grid points along direction \f$ i \f$, for each 
\f$ i = 0, \ldots , D-1 \f$ .
Reciprocal lattice vectors for which the Miller indices are aliases are 
also said to be aliases of one another.
Reciprocal lattice vectors that are aliases of one another yield values 
for the complex exponential \f$ \exp( i {\bf G}\cdots {\bf r} ) \f$ that 
are equal for any position vector \f$ {\bf r} \f$ that is a node of the 
relevant grid, but that are generally unequal for values of \f$ {\bf r} \f$ 
that do not lie on this grid.  Wavevectors that are aliases of one another 
are thus treated as equivalent within forward and inverse DFT operations,
in which values of the underlying field are only defined on the nodes of
a grid.

\subsection user_fourier_dft_inverse_sub Inverse DFT

A periodic function \f$ F \f$ that is defined on the nodes of grid can
can be expanded in terms of its DFT \f$ \tilde{F} \f$ by applying an 
inverse discrete Fourier transform
\anchor user_fourier_dftinverse_eqn
\f[
  F(m_0, \ldots, m_{D-1}) =
  \sum_{n_{0}=0}^{M_{0}-1} \cdots
  \sum_{n_{D-1}=0}^{M_{D-1}-1}
  \tilde{F}(n_{0},\ldots,n_{D-1})
  \exp \left (
  2\pi i \sum_{\alpha = 0}^{D-1} n_{\alpha} m_{\alpha}/M_{\alpha}
  \right )
\f]
Here, as elsewhere in this discussion \f$ F(m_0, \ldots, m_{D-1}) \f$
denotes the value of the function \f$ F \f$ at the grid point with
integer mesh indices \f$ m_{0}, \ldots, m_{D-1} \f$.  Note that the
sums over the indices \f$ n_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1} \f$ in an inverse
discrete DFT extend only over a finite number of values
\f$ n_{\alpha} = 0, \ldots, M_{\alpha}-1 \f$ for each index, giving
a finite rather than an infinite sum.

<em> Relationship to source code: </em>  The D-dimensional forward and
inverse DFT, defined using the conventions given above, are implemented for 
the field container classes used by pscf_pc programs by the member functions 
forwardTransform and inverseTransform defined in the class Pscf::Pspc::FFT<D>, 
respectively. The class Pscf::Pspc::FFT<D> is an instantiation of the class
template Pscf::Pscf::FFT, in which D=1, 2, or 3 is a template parameter that
represents the dimensionality of space.  These member functions are simple 
wrappers around functions provided by the open source FFTW package.  
Equivalent operations are implemented for the field container classes used 
by the pscf_pg programs by corresponding functions of the class Pscf::Pspg::FFT<D>, 
whch are wrappers around functions provided by the cuFFT CUDA library, which
implements FFTs on a GPU.

\section user_fourier_kindex_sec Wavevector Indexing Schemes

The phenomena of aliasing of wavevectors for fields that are defined on 
a grid means that there are infinite number of ways of defining Miller
indices so as to generate aliases of a particular wavevector, by adding 
or subtracting integer multiples of the number of grid points to each 
index.  Two different conventions are used in PSCF assign a unique list 
of indices to each wavevector within a DFT. We refer to the resulting 
conventions for lists of indices here as (1) discrete Fourier transform 
or DFT indices and (2) Minimal indices.

\subsection user_fourier_dftindex_sub DFT Indices
The DFT indices of a wavevector are defined such that the index
\f$ n_{i} \f$ associated with reduced coordinate \f$ i \f$ is required
to be in the range \f$ 0, \ldots, N_{i} - 1 \f$, where \f$ N_{i} \f$ is
the number of grid points in direction \f$ i \f$. This is the indexing
scheme used in the above definitions of the forward and inverse DFT
operations.

\subsection user_fourier_minindex_sub Minimal Indices
The minimal indices of a wavevector are indices that are chosen so as 
to give a corresponding Cartesian wavevector 
\f$ {\bf G}(n_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1}) \f$ as defined
\ref user_fourier_Gofn_eqn "above"
for which the magnitude  \f$ |{\bf G}| \f$ is minimum.  If several
different possible choices for Miller indices yield wavevector aliases
for which \f$ |{\bf G}| \f$ is equal to its minimum possible value, then
the BZ indices are taken by convention to be the choice which is "maximum"
(or last) when these candidates are ordered in order of increasing index
values while giving priority to indices that appear earlier in a list
\f$ (n_{0}, \ldots, n_{D-1}) \f$, thus ordering first by \f$ n_{0} \f$,
then ordering choices with equal values of \f$ n_{0} \f$ in order of
increasing \f$ n_{1} \f$, etc.

<em> Relationship to source code: </em>  The DFT and minimal indexes of a 
wavevector in D-dimensional space are assigned to each wavevector within 
the Pscf::Basis<D> class.  The indexing scheme that we refer to here  as
"minimal" indices here are instead referred Brillouin zone or "BZ" indices 
within the source code and documentation of the Pscf::Basis class template.
