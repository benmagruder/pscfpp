The first subblock of the main System block in every parameter file is labelled Mixture.  
The Mixture block describes the chemical composition of the system that is being simulated. 

PSCF programs are designed to treat a mixture that may contain one or more polymer species and zero or more solvent point-particle species.
Each polymer may be either a linear or acyclic branched block polymer.
Polymers and solvents are both built from a palette of a nMonomer monomer types. 
Each monomer is assigned a statistical segment length.
Each copolymer block and each solvent species is assigned an index in the 
range [0,..,nMonomer-1] that specifies the type of monomer from which it 
is constructed.
The Mixture block contains information that specifies the structure of
each polymer species within the mixture, the monomer type and volume of
each solvent species, and the composition of the mixture.

All pscf programs use the same format for the Mixture parameter file block. 
The Mixture block has the format
\code
Mixture{
  nMonomer   int
  monomers   Array [ Monomer ]
  nPolymer   int
  Polymer{ ... } 
    ...
  nSolvent*  int (0 by default)
  Solvent*{ ... }
    ...
  vMonomer*  float (1.0 by default)
  ds         float
}
\endcode
Here and in other descriptions of parameter file formats, labels followed by an asterisk (*) indicate optional parameters or subblocks.
The nSolvent parameter is an optional parameter that is set to zero by default, i.e., it is set to 0 if the parameter is omitted from the parameter file.
The number of Polymer subblocks must equal nPolymer, and the number of Solvent subblocks must equal nSolvent (i.e., no Solvent subblocks if nSolvent is ommitted).

Parameters and subblocks are described below:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td> nMonomer </td>
    <td> Number of distinct monomer types in the mixture </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> monomers </td>
    <td> 
    An array of nMonomer elements in which the value of each element gives the statistical segment length of the associated monomer type.
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> nPolymer </td>
    <td> The number of polymer species. This is a required positive integer.    </td> 
  </tr>
  <td> nSolvent* </td>
  <tr>
    <td> The number of solvent (point-particle) species. 
         This is an optional non-negative parameter that is set to a 
         default value of 0 if omitted.
    </td>
  <tr>
    <td> Polymer{ ... } </td>
    <td> 
       Each Polymer{ ... } subblock contain data for one Polymer species.  
       The Mixture block must contain exactly nPolymer such subblocks 
       immediately after the nPolymer and nSolvent parameters.
    </td>
  </tr>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Solvent{ ... } </td>
    <td> Each Solvent{ ... } subblock contains data for one point-like 
         Solvent species.  The number of solvent subblocks must equal
         nSolvent, or zero if nSolvent is omitted.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td> ds </td>
     <td> Preferred value for the block length step size used to 
          integrate the modified diffusion equation within each block.
          </td>
  </tr>
  </tr>
</table>

Monomer types are implicitly assigned integer identifiers in the order in which they appear in the monomers array. We thus assign an index 0 to the first monomer type, and index 1 to the second, and so on.  
These integer monomer type indices are used to identify the monomer types associated with each blocks of a block polymer and each solvent type.

Polymer and Solvent species are also assigned integer labels in the order in which object of a particular type appear in the parameter file.
The the first polymer is thus assigned an index 0, the second index 1, etc.
Similarly, the first solvent (if any) is assigned an index 0.
