The parameter file format for SCFT calculations using the pscf_pg
GPU-accelerated programs is almost identical to that for the pscf_pc 
programs. The Mixture and Interaction blocks use the same format as
the other PSCF programs, and the Domain block has the same format as
that used by the pscf_pc programs. The only differences are differences
in the available iterators.

\section user_param_pc_Iterator_section Iterators

The default iterator for pscf_pg programs uses an Anderson-Mixing (AM)
algorithm closely analogous to that used by the default AM iterator 
for pscf_pc programs. Like the pscf_pc AmIterator, this algorithm 
applies the AmIterator to a residual that is defined using an 
expansion in symmetry-adapted basis functins, and updates the chemical
potential fields by modifying the coefficients in this expansion. This
algorithm may be invoked in the parameter file for a pscf_pg program
using either the generic block label "Iterator" or a specific label
"AmIteratorBasis". 

The only other iterator currently provided for use with the pscf_pg
programs is an Anderson mixing in which the residual vector and 
changes in the w fields are instead formulated using vectors whose 
elements represent values of fields on the nodes of a regular spatial 
grid, rather than coefficients in a symmetry-adapated expansion. This
iterator is invoked using the label AmIteratorGrid.

can be found by following the links in the table below:
