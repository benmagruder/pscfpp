The parameter file format for SCFT calculations using the pscf_pg
GPU-accelerated program is almost identical to the parameter file 
format for the \ref user_param_pc_page "pscf_pc".
The Mixture and Interaction blocks use the same format as that used
by both pscf_fd and pscf_pc, and the Domain block has the same 
format as that used by pscf_pc. The only differences are differences 
in the available iterators.

\section user_param_pg_iterator_sec Iterators

The default iterator for pscf_pg uses an Anderson-Mixing (AM)
algorithm closely analogous to that used by the default AM iterator 
for pscf_pc, \ref pspc_AmIterator_page "Pspc::AmIterator". 
Like the pscf_pc AmIterator, this algorithm applies the Anderson mixing
algorithm to a residual that is defined using an expansion in 
symmetry-adapted basis functins, and updates the chemical potential 
fields by modifying the coefficients in this expansion. This algorithm 
may be invoked in the parameter file for pscf_pg using either the 
generic block label "Iterator" or a specific label "AmIteratorBasis". 

The only other iterator currently provided for use with pscf_pg
is an Anderson mixing in which the residual vector and 
changes in the w fields are instead formulated using vectors whose 
elements represent values of fields on the nodes of a regular spatial 
grid, rather than coefficients in a symmetry-adapated expansion. This
iterator is invoked using the label AmIteratorGrid.

Descriptions of the parameter file formats for the available iterators
can be found by following the links in the table below:

\section user_param_pg_sweep_sec Sweep

The only sweep algorithm currently available for use with pspc_pg is a
general linear sweep algorithm. This can be invoked by including a block 
that starts either with the generic label Sweep or the specific label 
LinearSweep.  The required parameter file format for a linear sweep has 
been described \ref user_param_sweep_linear_sec "here".
