Each PSCF program can read and write files that contain chemical potential
and monomer volume fraction fields. Several different file formats are used
to represent these fields and other quantities that can be expressed
mathematically as functions of one or more spatial coordinates.  

The pscf_pcN and pscf_pgN, which are both designed to treat periodic 
microstructures, both use file formats similar to those that were originally 
created for the older Fortran PSCF program. These formats are described 
in the first three subsection listed below.

The pscf_fd program for one-dimensional problems uses a simpler 
\ref user_field_fd1d_page "file format" in which values of fields 
specified at nodes of a regular one-dimensional grid.
