<BR>

Here is a example of a simple command file for any of pscf_pcNd programs 
for N-dimensionally periodic microstructures (i.e., for pscf_pc1d, 
pscf_pc2d, or pscf_pc3d):
\code
READ_W_BASIS    in/w.bf
ITERATE         
WRITE_W_BASIS   out/w.bf
WRITE_C_BASIS   out/c.bf
WRITE_C_RGRID   out/c.rf
WRITE_PARAM     out/data
WRITE_THERMO    out/data
FINISH
\endcode
The command "READ_W_BASIS in/w.bf" instructs the program to read an 
initial guess for the chemical potentials fields from the file in/w.bf, 
which should use contain the components of the fields as an expansion in 
a symmetry-adapted Fourier basis. The ITERATE command instructs the 
program to iteratively solve the SCFT equations starting from this initial 
guess.  The command "WRITE_W_BASIS out/w.bf" writes the resulting 
converged set of chemical potential fields to file out/w.bf in 
symmetry-adapted basis format. The command "WRITE_C_BASIS out/c.bf" writes 
the corresponding monomer volume fraction fields to the file out/c.bf in 
the same format, while "WRITE_C_RGRID out/c.rf" writes the volume fraction
fields in r-grid format. The command "WRITE_PARAM out/data" writes the 
param file for the current system to a file. The following command, 
"WRITE_THERMO out/data", appends the thermodynamic properties of the 
converged solution to the end of out/data, which already contains the 
param file. The script stops execution when it encounters the 
FINISH command.

Many of the available commands for the pscf_pcNd programs cause the 
program to read and/or write a set of chemical potential (w) fields or 
monomer concentration (c) fields to or from file.  These program can 
read and write fields in any of three formats:

 - "basis" format contains components in a symmetry-adapted Fourier basis

 - "r-grid" format contains field values on nodes of a regular real-space grid

 - "k-grid" format contains components of a discrete Fourier transform (DFT)

The "basis" and "r-grid" fromats are identical to corresponding formats
used by the Fortran PSCF program. 

The following table shows a list of available commands for the pscf_pcNd 
programs:
