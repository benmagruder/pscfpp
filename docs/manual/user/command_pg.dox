Most of the available commands for the pscf_pg programs GPU programs are 
generally similar to those used by the pscf_pc CPU programs. 
Users of pscf_pg programs should thus consult the documentation for
\ref user_command_pc_page "pscf_pc commands" for a list of commands,
with the differences listed below in mind.

The only differences between pscf_pg and pscf_pg commands are that the 
following following pscf_pc commands are currently not available in 
pscf_pg:

   - Commands for reading and writing external fields
     (READ_H_BASIS, READ_H_RGRID, WRITE_H_BASIS, and WRITE_H_RGRID) .

   - Commands for reading and writing external mask fields 
     (READ_MASK_BASIS, READ_MASK_RGRID, WRITE_MASK_BASIS, WRITE_MASK_RGRID).

   - Commands CHECK_RGRID_SYMMETRY, COMPARE_BASIS and COMPARE_RGRID

The commands to read and write external fields are not available for
pscf_pg programs because the underlying features have not yet been 
implemented.
