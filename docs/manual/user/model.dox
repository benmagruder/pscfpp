This page provides an overview of the input parameters required by all
of the programs in the PSCF package to characterize a physical system, 
as well as a discussion of the system of units and conventions used to 
define parameter values. 

\section user_model_overview_sec Physical model (overview)

All of the programs in the PSCF software package are designed to compute
properties of a system that contains an incompressible liquid mixture 
of one or more polymers and zero or more small molecule solvents. Each
polymer species in such a mixture may be either a linear block polymer 
or an acyclic branched block polymer with a user-specified connectivity.
Homopolymers are treated as a special case of a block polymer with only
one block. Conformations of individual polymers may bed treated either
using a model of linear polymer segments as continuous random walks (a
"thread" model), or a model of each segment as a sequence of discrete 
beads connected by harmonic bonds (a "bead" model).  Solvent species, 
when present, are treated as structureless point-like particles that
occupy a specified volume per particle.

The only model for interactions among molecules that is currently
implemented is one that uses a symmetric matrix of Flory-Huggins 
parameters to characterize local binary interactions among polymer 
blocks and solvent species of different monomer types.

Both polymers and solvent species are constructed from the same list of
monomer types. Each block within a block polymer is assigned a monomer
type (identified by an integer index) and a block length . The block 
length is given as a floating point number in the continuous thread 
model and as an integer number of beads in the discrete bead model. In
either case, the length of a block determines how much volume it occupies 
within an incompressible liquid.  Each small-molecule solvent species is 
assigned a monomer type index and a steric volume.

The physical information required to describe a model for either a
SCFT or PS-FTS calculation thus include:

  - The number of different monomer types present in the system and
    a value for the statistical segment length of each monomer type.

  - A description of each polymer species that includes the length
    and monomer type of each block and a description of how the 
    blocks are connected.

  - A specification of the monomer type and size (i.e., volume) of
    each solvent species.

  - A value for either the volume fraction or chemical potential of
    each polymer and solvent molecular species.

  - A value for a binary Flory-Huggins interaction parameter
    \f$ \chi_{ij} \f$ for interactions between monomers of types
    \f$ i \f$ and \f$ j \f$ for each distinct pair of monomer
    types.

  - Parameters that describe the unit cell (for periodic structures)
    or spatial domain of interest.

In addition, PS-FTS calculations also require the value of a monomer 
reference volume (i.e., volume per monomer in an incompressible liquid), 
but this parameter is normally not needed for SCFT calculations. 

PSCF users are also required to provide a variety of algorithmic 
parameters required by various numerical algorithms. Among these are 
parameters that define a spatial discreteization for the unit cell 
or spatial domain, e.g., by defining the number of grid points along
each direction of a computational mesh.  Calculations that use the 
continuous thread model also require a target value for a contour 
length step size ds that is used to discretize the contour of each 
block in numerical solutions of the modified diffusion equation. 
Other algorithms (such as iteration algorithms used in SCFT or 
sampling algorithms used for PS-FTS) require a variety of other 
specialized parameters and options.

\section user_model_energy_sec Energy units

For input and output values of all quantities with units that involve 
energy, PSCF uses "thermal" units for energy in which \f$ k_{B}T = 1\f$, 
where \f$ k_{B} \f$ is Boltmann's constant and \f$ T \f$ is absolute
temperature. For instance, the chemical potential values reported in 
the parameter files are reported as \f$ \mu / k_{B}T \f$. 

\section user_model_length_sec Length units

PSCF allows the user to use any unit of length for quantities that
involve units of length, as long as the same choice of unit is used
for all input parameters. The user is not asked to declare a specific
choice for a unit of length, but is responsible for providing values
that are have been chosen using some consistent choice of unit.

The only parameters required for a standard SCFT calculation that have
units involving length are the values of the statistical segment lengths,
and values (or initial guesses) for the dimensions of the periodic unit
cell or spatial domain of the system of interest. In addition, PS-FTS 
calculations require a value for the monomer reference volume, which 
has units of volume, or length cubed. Users may initialize a calculation 
using input files in which these parameters are all defined either using 
some standard microscopic length unit (e.g., Angstroms or nanometers) 
or in which they are all defined using some user-defined system of 
non-dimensional units. Different common choice of conventions are 
discussed below.

If input parameters supplied by a  user are consistently assigned 
values that were defined using some unit of length, output values will 
be reported using the same units for length.  Thus, in SCFT simulations 
of a periodic microstructures in which one or more dimensions of the
crystal unit cell are iteratively ajdusted so as to minimize the
free energy density, output values for the optimized unit cell
parameters will be reported in the same length units as those used
to define statistical segment lengths.

Most outputs of an SCFT calculation other than the optimal values
for unit cell parameters, such as the free energy per chain in a
one-component block polymer melt or the compositions associated with
phase boundaries in a phase portrait) can be shown to depend on
input parameters with units of lengths only through the values of
ratios of lengths involving unit cell or domain dimensions and
unperturbed dimensions of blocks or polymers that are present 
within a system (i.e., RMS end-to-end lengths or radii of gyration).

\section user_model_polymer_sec Polymer Species

In any PSCF program, each polymer species may be declared to be either
a linear block polymer (the default), which contains a sequence of one
or more blocks of specified lengths and monomer types, or an acyclic 
branched block polymer.  Homopolymers are treated as a special case of 
a linear block polymer with only one block. 

The pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs can also treat polymers using either 
of two slightly different mathematical models, which we refer to as 
the discrete "bead" model and the continuous "thread" model. 

<ul>

<li> The **bead** model is based on an concrete physical picture of 
each block of a block polymer as a sequence of discrete point particles,
or "beads", connected by harmonic springs. 
</li>

<li>
The **thread** model instead idealizes each block of a polymer as a 
continuous random walk, with no discrete beads or monomers. 
</li>

</ul>
The pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs for systems with periodic boundary 
conditions can perform either SCFT or PS-FTS calculations, and can use 
either the thread or bead model for either type of calculation.  In 
both of these programs, the choice of bead or thread model is global 
- the same model must be used for all blocks of all polymer species 
in the system. 

The pscf_1d program for one-dimensional systems can only use the thread 
model, and can only perform SCFT calculations.  

Calculations that use the thread model use numerical algorithms to 
solve the modified diffusion equation actually do discretize the contour 
length of each block into steps of some length \f$ ds \f$. In this model,
however, users input values for block lengths and \f$ ds \f$ separately,
and \f$ ds \f$ is understood to be an algorithmic parameter rather than
a property of the underlying physical model.  Numerical algorithms used 
for the thread model are designed to converge rapidly to the continuus 
thread limit as \f$ ds \f$ is decreased while block lengths and other
parameters are held fixed.  Algorithms used for the bead model are instead 
designed to reproduce the properties of this inherently discrete model 
as accurately as possible. 

We generally recommend the use of the thread model in pscf_pc and 
pscf_pg for SCFT calculations, because it provides numerical results 
that are more nearly independent of how each block is discretized, thus 
reducing the number of parameter required to describe a system and to
interpret the results. Both bead and thread models have been used in 
recent work on on PS-FTS calculations. For this purpose, the main 
advantage of the bead model is that it is less computationally 
expensive.

\subsection user_model_bead_sub Discrete "bead" model

In the "bead" model, each block of a block polymer is taken to consist of 
a sequence of discrete beads connected by harmonic springs. In this model, 
the user must specify the integer number of beads in each block of the 
polymer, which is given in a parameter file by a parameter named "nBead". 

Suppose the beads in a block containing \f$ N \f$ beads are indexed an 
integer \f$ s = 0, \ldots, N-1 \f$. Let \f$ {\bf R}(s) \f$ denote the 
position of bead number s.  In this model, a chain segment connecting beads
\f$ s \f$ and \f$ s' \f$ within a block of monomer type \f$ \alpha \f$ 
within a system of non-interacting chains would exhibit a mean-squared 
end-to-end length given by
\f[
    \langle |{\bf R}(s) - {\bf R}(s')|^{2} \rangle_{0}
    =  |s-s'| b_{\alpha}^{2} \quad,
\f]
in which \f$ b_{\alpha} \f$ is the statistical segment length for a 
bond that connects two monomers of type \f$ \alpha \f$. In this model, 
neighboring beads within a block of monomer type \f$ \alpha \f$ are 
connected by harmonic springs with a spring constant 
\f$ 3 kT / b_{\alpha}^{2} \f$.

In the bead model for an incompressible system, every bead is assumed to 
occupy a volume given by the monomer volume parameter \f$ v \f$, which 
has the same value for every type of monomer.

The treatment of bonds that connect terminal beads of different blocks 
to junctions and branch points is discussed in detail
\ref user_branched_page "elsewhere".

\subsection user_model_continuous_sub Continuous "thread" model

In the thread model, we imagine that the conformation of a single block 
of contour length \f$ L \f$ within a block polymer can be characterized 
by a continous path \f$ \textbf{R}(s) \f$ that gives the position 
\f$ {\bf R} \f$ of a point along the polymer as a function of a 
dimensionless contour coordinate \f$ s \f$, for \f$ s \in [0, L] \f$.  

In this model, a chain segment between points with contour coordinates 
\f$ s \f$ and \f$ s' \f$ within a block of monomer type \f$ \alpha \f$ 
in a gas of non-interacting polymers is given by
\f[
    \langle |{\bf R}(s) - {\bf R}(s')|^{2} \rangle
    = |s-s'| b_{\alpha}^{2} \quad,
\f]
in which \f$ b_{\alpha} \f$ is a statistical segment length for chain
segments of type \f$ \alpha \f$. Here, \f$ \langle \cdots \rangle \f$
denotes a statistical average over random-walk configurations within a 
homogeneous mixture. 

In an incompressible mixture, each linear chain segment of contour length 
\f$ |s-s'| \f$ is assumed to occupy a volume \f$ V(s,s') \f$ given 
by \f[
    V(s,s') = v|s-s'| \quad,
\f]
where \f$ v \f$ is a monomer volume parameter.
We sometimes refer to the parameter \f$ v \f$ as the monomer reference 
volume. In the thread model, however, it is better understood as steric 
volume per unit polymer contour length. By convention, PSCF requires 
that this volume parameter be the same for all monomer types.

\section user_model_solvent_sec Solvent species

PSCF allows user to model polymer solutions by including zero or more
"solvent" species in addition to one or more polymer species. Each
solvent molecule is treated as a mobile but structureless point-like
particle that occupies some volume within an incompressible mixture.
Solvent species can be used to model either rigid small-molecule solvent 
molecules or oligomeric chain molecules that much smaller than all of 
the "polymer" species present in the same system.

Each solvent species is assigned a monomer type that is selected from
among the same list of monomer types at that used to describe polymer 
blocks. A solvent that has properties that are distinct from those of 
any of the monomers used to construct the polymer species can be assigned 
an extra monomer type that is simply not used as the monomer type for 
any polymer block. A solvent species can instead be assigned a monomer 
type that is the same as that assigned to one or block polymer blocks 
if that solvent species represents a small oligomer of the specified 
monomer type, or another species with physical properties very similar 
to those of such an oligomer.  The input file format for PSCF requires 
that a monomer type that this is only associated with a solvent species 
must must still be assigned a statistical segment length value, but in 
this case that segment length value would simply not be unused.

Each solvent species is also assigned a volume per molecule. This is 
specified in the PSCF input files by a dimensionless parameter labelled 
"size".  The value of the size parameter is equal to the ratio of the 
solvent molecular volume to the mononer reference volume \f$ v \f$. The 
"size" parameter for a solvent species is thus closely analogous to the 
"length" parameter for a polymer block in a thread model, since both are 
defined as volumes measured in units of the monomer reference volume.
The size parameter for a solvent is always specified as a real (i.e., 
floating point) number, whether the bead or thread model is used for
polymer species. 

\section user_model_conventions_sec Coarse-Graining and Parameter Conventions

PSCF is based on a coarse-grained picture of polymer statistics that 
does not attempt to accurately represent details of chemical structure.
The use of a coarse-grained model inherently introduces some freedom 
into the definition of what one means by a "monomer", and thus into 
the choice of values for the contour length (in the thread model) or 
number of beads (in the bead model) used to describe a block. 
When using a bead model, the conceptually straightforward choice would 
arguably be to choose the number of beads used in PSCF equal to the 
number of actual chemical repeat units within the corresponding block 
of some real polymer of interest. Even that definition leaves some 
ambiguity, however, because one always has the freedom to redefine 
what one means by a monomer by grouping together two or more elementary 
chemical repeat units into a larger unit.  For example, when describing 
a long linear alkane (i.e., linear polyethylene) one could treat either 
a 1-carbon or 2-carbon unit as a "monomer". This regrouping operation 
changes the value one would obtain for the number of monomers in a 
given chain segment, and also changes the associated values of the 
monomer statistical segment length and volume per monomer. For example, 
a 100 carbon alkane segment could be described as having a "length" of 
100 units using one-carbon monomers or 50 units for two-carbon monomers, 
using larger values for the statistical segment length \f$ b \f$ and the 
volume \f$ v \f$ per monomer in the model with fewer models. 

This freedom to change conventions for block lengths becomes 
particularly obvious in the thread model, which allows the use of block 
lengths that are not integers and that can be defined so as to be less 
than 1. In this model, we implicitly assume that the number of elementary 
chemical repeat units in any chain segment of interest is sufficiently 
large that we may ignore details of chemical structure and characterize 
positions along a polymer by a real (rather than integer) contour 
coordinate \f$ s \f$.  The contour length \f$ |s-s'| \f$ of a segment 
between two points in the same block with contour coordinates \f$ s \f$ 
and \f$ s' \f$ is assumed to be proportional, but generally not equal, 
to the number of chemical repeat units contained in the chain segment 
between those points. As a result, the dimensionless contour length of 
a chain segment is also proportional to the molecular weight of that 
segment.  Values for the constants of proportionality that determine 
the number of elementary chemical repeat units and molecular weight 
per unit contour length for each type of block are not, however, specified 
by the equations used within PSCF. The software is instead designed to
allow users to choose from among a variety of possible conventions for 
these constants of proportionality. The cost of this flexibility is, 
of course, that it places responsibility on the user to choose and
understand a convention and to make sure that the chosen convention is
accurately reflected in the values chosen for all input parameters.

The only restriction that PSCF places on the definition of polymer
contour lengths in the thread model is a requirement that, as a matter 
of convention, chain segments of equal contour length but different 
monomer type correspond to the same volume within an incompressible melt. 
The steric volume of any chain segment of contour length \f$ L \f$ is
thus given by \f$ v L \f$ , for segments of any monomer type, using
the same value for the monomer reference volume \f$ v \f$ for segments
of any monomer type.  The requirement that the same monomer volume 
per unit contour length be used for all monomer types does not lead
to any loss of generality in a coarse-grained model, as long as 
different values may be assigned for the statistical segment lengths 
of different monomer types.  

There are two common types of convention for block contour lengths
used in the thread model, which we refer to here as "experimentalist" 
and "theorist" conventions.  Both are described below. Experimentalist 
conventions are often convenient for computational studies that are 
being used to predict behavior for a particular experimental system 
with blocks of known chemistry and molecular weight. Theorist 
conventions are instead often convenient for studies of trends with 
changes in parameters, and for studies of phase maps for classes of 
systems for which it is known that predictions of relevant thermodynamic 
properties can be parameterized by a small set of dimensionless 
parameters.

\anchor user_model_thread_experimentalist
<b> "Experimentalist" Conventions: </b>
In the "experimentalist" convention, a monomer (i.e., a unit of contour
length) is defined for each monomer type so as to correspond to a
segment with a molecular weight chosen so that the volume occupied by 
that segment in a polymer melt is equal to a chosen value for a monomer 
reference volume \f$ v \f$. This is a standard approach used in the 
literature in studies that compare experimental results to predictions 
of the Flory-Huggins theory for polymer solutions and mixtures, the 
random-phase approximation (RPA) theory of small-angle scattering 
and/or to SCFT predictions for inhomogeneous structures.  

In such studies, the reference volume \f$ v \f$ is usually chosen to have 
a value of of order 50 - 100 cubic Angstrom that is comparable to the 
volume of some common hydrocarbon chemical repeat unit containing a few 
carbon atoms. Ultimately, however, choice of a value for \f$ v \f$ is 
arbitrary. In a system that contains two or more different types of 
monomer, it generally not possible to choose a single value for the 
reference volume that corresponds to the volume per chemical repeat unit 
of every monomer type, because volumes different types of repeat units are 
generally different. 

The contour length \f$ L \f$ of a chemically homogeneous polymer segment 
of some known molecular weight \f$ M \f$ and monomers of type \f$ a \f$
may be expressed as a ratio
\f[
   L  = M/m_{\alpha} \quad,
\f]
in which \f$ m_{\alpha} \f$ is a molecular weight per unit contour length
(or per monomer reference volume) for monomers of type \f$ a \f$. The
quantity \f$ m_{\alpha} \f$ must be defined for each monomer type such 
that the volume occupied per chain segment of molecular weight
\f$ m_{\alpha} \f$ in a polymer melt corresponds to the value chosen 
for \f$ v \f$. If a melt of homopolymers containing monomers of type
\f$ \alpha \f$ exhibits a density \f$ \rho_{\alpha} \f$ in grams per
volume at the tempeature and pressure of interest, then the value of
\f$ m_{\alpha} \f$ for that monomer type is given in grams per mole as
\f[
   m_{\alpha} = \rho_{\alpha} v N_{\rm A} \quad
\f]
where \f$ N_{\rm A} \f$ is Avogadro's number. If \f$ \rho_{\alpha} \f$
is given in grams per cubic centimeter and \f$ v \f$ is given in cubic
Angstroms, then a numerical conversion factor of \f$ 10^{-24} \f$ cubic
centimeter per cubic Angstrom is also required to obtain consistent
units.

The value for the statistical segment length \f$ b_{\alpha} \f$ associated
with a specific monomer type is then given by
\f[
   b^{2}_{\alpha} = m \frac{R_{e}^{2}(M)}{M}
\f]
where \f$ R_{e}^{2}(M) \f$ denotes the mean-squared end-to-end length
for a homopolymer chain of molecular weight \f$ M \f$ and monomer type
\f$ \alpha \f$.
Note that the ratio \f$ R_{e}^{2}(M)/M \f$ is independent of molecular
weight for chains with random-walk statistics. If a value for the
statistical segment length is known for some other definition of a
monomer unit (such as a chemical repeat unit, or an effective monomer
defined using a different value for \f$ v \f$ ), then the ratio
\f$ R_{e}^{2}/M \f$ may be replaced by ratio of the square of the
statistical segment length for that monomer definition divided by the
molecular weight per monomer. In experimentalist conventions, Angstrom
or nanometer units are usually used for all lengths.

\anchor user_model_thread_theorist
<b> "Theorist" Conventions </b>:
In a "theorist" convention, contour coordinates are scaled so as to
define the overall contour length of some reference chain or chain segment
to be equal to 1.0 by convention.  The reference chain is often chosen
to correspond to either an entire molecule of some polymer species that
is present in the system, or one block of one such  species.  This is
equivalent to setting the "monomer" reference volume equal to the
occupied volume of the entire reference polymer or block.  Because the
equations implemented by PSCF require that the volume per contour length
must be the same for blocks of different monomer types, values for
ratios of block or chain lengths must be equal to corresponding ratios
of occupied volumes. In this convention, the length assigned to each
block of each polymer must thus be equal to the ratio of the actual
volume of that block to the volume of the reference chain.

For example, in a system that contains a single linear block polymer
species, the length of the entire polymer is often set equal to 1.0 by
convention. In this convention, we  assign the blocks of that polymer
block lengths that are each less than 1 and that add to exactly 1.
In the case of a one-component block polymer melt, the value of each
such block length is then equal to the volume fraction of that block.

The use of theorist convention for contour lengths is compatible with the 
use of either physical Angstrom or nanometer length units or with the use 
of a convenient system of non-dimensionalized units for length.  The 
simplest scheme for definining non-dimensionalized lengths is to define 
the statistical segment length of one monomer type to be equal to 1.0 by 
convention. In this case, one must then assign every other monomer type 
a statistical segment length given by the ratio of its actual statistical 
segment length (e.g., its statistical segment length defined using an 
experimentalist convention) to that of the reference monomer type. Note 
that the values of ratios of statistical segment lengths are unchanged 
by changes in one's convention for the monomer reference volume.

If one describes a polymer solution in a thread model using "theorist" 
units in which the reference volume it defined to be equal to the total 
volume of some reference polymer species, then values for the solvent 
size parameter will usually much less than 1.0. Thus for example, a 
system with a homopolymer of length 1.0 and a solvent with a size equal 
to 0.01 could be used to describe a homopolymer solution in which the
polymer molecular volume is 100 times greater than that of the solvent.  
It is also valid, and sometimes more convenient, to describe a solution 
using a theorist convention in which the volume of the solvent species 
is taken as the reference volume. In this case, the solvent size wil be 
set equal to 1.0 by convention, and the lengths for polymer blocks will 
generally be much greater than 1.

All of the SCFT examples shown in this user's manual use a theorist 
convention in which the overall length of one type of polymer (i.e., the 
sum of the length of the blocks for a block polymer) is set to 1.0, and 
in which the statistical segment length of at least one monomer type is 
set to 1.0.  This type of convention is also used in the input files for 
all of the examples provided with PSCF.

\section user_model_vMonomer_sec Monomer Reference Volume

A value for the monomer reference volume \f$ v \f$ is not required as 
an input to a standard SCFT calculation.  As discussed 
\ref user_model_continuous_sub "above", when using a simplified model of 
a polymer to analyze a specific experimental system, the choice of a 
convention for the monomer reference volume \f$ v \f$ determines the 
appropriate choice of values for several types of related parameters, 
such as the block lengths, monomer statistical segment lengths, and 
interaction parameters. It turns out, however, that once the values of 
these related parameters are determined, the value of \f$ v \f$ itself 
is not needed as an additional independent input to an SCFT calculation.  

It can be shown that changes in the value of \f$ v \f$ alone, without 
corresponding changes in the values assigned to related parameters 
(e.g., statistical segment lengths, block lengths and chi parameters) 
have no effect values of any of the properties normally output at the 
end of a PSCF SCFT calculation. Specifically, changes in the value of 
\f$ v \f$ alone can be shown to have no effect on SCFT predictions for 
average monomer volume fraction fields, polymer or solvent chemical 
potential values, or the non-dimensionalized SCFT Helmholtz free 
energy that is reported in the standard output of SCFT 
\ref scft_thermo_page "thermodynamic properties", which is reported as
free energy per monomer normalized by \f$ kT \f$.

A value for \f$ v \f$ is, however, always required as an independent
input parameter for stochastic FTS calculations. If all other parameters
are held fixed, smaller values for \f$ v \f$ lead to more overlap among 
polymers, and weaker field fluctuations. In systems with a single block
polymers species of total chain length \f$ N \f$ and a single statistical 
segment length \f$ b \f$, the extent of overlap and the magnitude of 
fluctuations can be characterized by a dimensionless parameter 
\f$ \overline{N} = N (b^{3}/v)^2 \f$ known as the invariant degree of 
polymerization.  SCFT predictions are recovered in the limit 
\f$ \overline{N} \rightarrow \infty \f$ or, equivalenty, in the limit 
\f$ v \rightarrow \infty \f$. 

<em> Example </em>: When performing a PS-FTS calculation for such a 
system using "theorist" units, one may could choose a convention in which 
\f$ N = 1 \f$ and \f$ b = 1 \f$ and then choose a value of \f$ v \f$ so 
as to obtain a desired value for \f$ \overline{N} \f$, e.g., using
\f$ v = 10^{-2} \f$ to obtain \f$ \overline{N} = 10^{4} \f$.
