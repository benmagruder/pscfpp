This page provides an overview of the input parameters required by all
of the programs in the PSCF package to characterize a physical system, 
as well as a discussion of the system of units and conventions used to 
define parameter values. 

\section user_model_overview_sec Physical model (overview)

All of the programs in the PSCF software package are designed to compute
properties of a system that contains an incompressible liquid mixture of
one or more block polymers and zero or more small molecule solvents. Each
polymer species in such a mixture may be either a linear block polymer or
an acyclic branched block polymer with a user-specified connectivity.
Homopolymers are treated as a special case of a block polymer with only
one block. Conformations of individual polymers is treated using a model
of linear polymer segments as continuous random walks, as discussed below.
Solvent species, when present, are treated as structureless point-like
particles that occupy a specified volume per particle.

The only model for interactions among molecules that is currently
implemented is one that treats the mixture as an incompressible liquid,
and that uses a symmetric matrix of Flory-Huggins parameters to
characterize binary interactions among polymer blocks and solvent
species of different monomer types.

Both polymers and solvent species are constructed from a finite list of
monomer types. Each block within a block polymer is assigned a monomer
type (identified by an integer index) and a block length (given as a
floating point number). The length of a block determines how much volume
it occupies within an incompressible liquid, as well as the root
mean-square (RMS) end-to-end length of the block in a homogeneous
liquid.  Each small-molecule solvent species is assigned a monomer 
type index and a steric volume.

The information required to describe the chemical composition of a
model thus includes:

  - The number of different monomer types present in the system and
    a value for the statistical segment length of each monomer.

  - A description of each polymer species that includes the length
    and monomer type of each block and description of how the blocks
    are connected at junctions.

  - A specification of the monomer type and size (i.e., volume) of
    each solvent species.

  - A value for either the volume fraction or chemical potential of
    each polymer and solvent molecular species.

  - A value for a binary Flory-Huggins interaction parameter
    \f$ \chi_{ij} \f$ for interactions between monomers of types
    \f$ i \f$ and \f$ j \f$ for each distinct pair of monomer
    types.

Other user-provided input parameters required to initialize a SCFT or
FTS calculation include:

  -  Parameters that describe the unit cell (for periodic structures)
     or spatial domain within which the self-consistent field equations
     will be solved.

  -  Parameters that define a spatial discretization for the unit
     cell or spatial domain.

  -  A contour length step size for discretization of polymer blocks
     into steps used for numerical integration.

Particular numerical algorithms may require a variety of other
algorithmic parameter and options.

\section user_model_energy_sec Energy units

In all input parameter and output values with units that involve
energy, PSCF uses "thermal" units for energy in which \f$ k_{B}T = 1\f$,
where \f$ k_{B} \f$ is Boltmann's constant and \f$ T \f$ is absolute
temperature. For instance, the chemical potential values reported in
the parameter files are reported as \f$ \mu / k_{B}T \f$.

\section user_model_length_sec Length units

PSCF allows the user to use any system of units for quantities that
involve units of length, as long as the same choice of units is used
for all input parameters. The user is not asked to declare a specific
choice of a unit of length, but is responsible for providing values
that are have been chosen using some consistent choice of unit.

The only required parameters for a standard SCFT calculation that have
units involving length are the values of the statistical segment lengths,
and values (or initial guesses) for the dimensions of the crystal unit
cell or spatial domain of the system of interest.  Users may initialize
a calculation using input files in which these parameters are define
either using some standard microscopic length unit (e.g., Angstroms or
nanometers) or in which they are defined using some user-defined system
of non-dimensional units. Different common choice of conventions are
discussed below.

If user-supplied input parameters are consistently assigned values
that were defined using some unit of length, output values will be
reported using the same units for length.  Thus, in simulations of
a periodic microstructures in which one or more dimensions of the
crystal unit cell are iteratively ajdusted so as to minimize the
free energy density, output values for the optimized unit cell
parameters will be reported in the same length units as those used
for relevant input parameters.

Most outputs of an SCFT calculation other than the optimal values
for unit cell parameters, such as the free energy per chain in a
one-component block polymer melt or the compositions associated with
phase boundaries in a phase portrait) can be shown to depend on
input parameters with units of lengths only through the values of
ratios of lengths involving unit cell or domain dimensions and
unperturbed coil sizes (i.e., RMS end-to-end lengths or radii of
gyration) of polymers or blocks of the polymer species present
within a system.

\section user_model_polymer_sec Polymer Species

The pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs can treat polymers using either of two 
slightly different mathematical models, which we refer to as the "thread" 
and "bead" model. 

<ul>
<li>
The **thread** model idealizes each block of a polymer as a continuous 
random walk, with no discrete beads or monomers. In the threat model
the length of each block is specified by a real (i.e., floating
point) number.  </li>

<li> The **bead** model is instead based on a physical picture of each 
block as a sequence of discrete point-like particles, or "beads", 
connected by harmonic springs. In the bead model, the length of each 
block is specified by an integer number of beads.</li>

</ul>
The pscf_1d program only uses the thread model.

We generally recommend the use of the thread model for SCFT calculations,
because of this models greater univerality. Either model can be used in
FTS calculations, and both have been used in published FTS studies. 

\subsection user_model_continuous_sub Continuous "thread" model

In the thread model, we imagine that any conformation of a single block 
of contour length \f$ L \f$ within a block polymer can be characterized 
by a continous path \f$ \textbf{R}(s) \f$ that gives the position 
\f$ {\bf R} \f$ of a point along the polymer as a function of a 
dimensionless contour coordinate \f$ s \f$, for \f$ s \in [0, L] \f$.  

In this model, a chain segment between points with contour coordinates 
\f$ s \f$ and \f$ s' \f$ within a block of monomer type \f$ \alpha \f$ 
is assumed to exhibit a mean-squared end-to-end length in a homogeneous 
system given by
\f[
    \langle |{\bf R}(s) - {\bf R}(s')|^{2} \rangle_{0}
    = |s-s'| b_{\alpha}^{2} \quad,
\f]
in which \f$ b_{\alpha} \f$ is a statistical segment length for chain
segments of type \f$ \alpha \f$. Here, \f$ \langle \cdots \rangle_{0} \f$
denotes a statistical average over random-walk configurations within a 
homogeneous mixture.  

In an incompressible mixture, each linear chain segment of contour length 
\f$ |s-s'| \f$ is also assumed to occupy a volume \f$ V(s,s') \f$ given by
\f[
    V(s,s') = v|s-s'| \quad,
\f]
where \f$ v \f$ is a monomer volume parameter.
We sometimes refer to the parameter \f$ v \f$ as the monomer reference 
volume, but in the thread model it is better understood as steric volume 
per unit polymer contour length. By convention, PSCF requires that this 
volume parameter be the same for all monomer types.

In the above discussion of the continuous chain model, we introduced
the notion of a dimensionless "contour length" of a chemically homogeneous
segment of polymer, such as a block within a block polymer. The simplest
way one might try to define such a length is to take it equal to the
number of chemical monomers within that segment. Even that definition
leaves some ambiguity, however, because one always has some freedom
to redefine what one means by a monomer by grouping together two or
more elementary chemical repeat units into a larger unit that we may
then treat as a "monomer".  For example, when describing a long linear
alkane (i.e., linear polyethylene) one could treat either a 1-carbon or
2-carbon unit as a "monomer". This regrouping operation changes the
value one would obtain for the number of monomers in a given chain
segment, as well as the required values of the monomer statistical
segment length and volume per monomer. For example a 100 carbon alkane
segment could be described as having a "length" of 100 units using
one-carbon monomers or 50 units for two-carbon monomers, using
different values for the statistical segment length \f$ b \f$ and
the volume \f$ v \f$ per monomer in these two cases.

In the continuous thread model, we implicitly assume that the number 
of elementary chemical repeat units in any chain segment of interest 
is sufficiently large that we may ignore details of chemical structure 
and characterize positions along a polymer by some sort of real 
(rather than integer) contour coordinate \f$ s \f$.  The contour length 
\f$ |s-s'| \f$ of a segment between two points on the same chain with 
contour coordinates \f$ s \f$ and \f$ s' \f$ is then assumed to be 
proportional, but generally not equal, to the number of elementary
chemical repeat units contained in the chain segment between those
points. As a result, the dimensionless contour length of a chain
segment is also proportional to the molecular weight of that segment.
Values for the constants of proportionality that determine the number
of elementary chemical repeat units and molecular weight per unit
contour length for each type of block are not, however, specified by
the equations used within PSCF. The software is instead designed to
allow to choose from among a variety of possible conventions for these
constants of proportionality. The cost of this flexibility is, of
course, that it places responsibility on the user to choose and
understand a convention and to make sure that the chosen convention is
accurately reflected in the values of user-supplied input parameters.

The only restriction that PSCF places on the definition of polymer
contour lengths is that a requirement that, as a matter of convention,
chain segments of equal contour length but different monomer type
correspond to the same volume within an incompressible melt. The
steric volume of any chain segment of contour length \f$ L \f$ is
thus given by \f$ v L \f$ , for segments of any monomer type, using
the same value for the monomer reference volume \f$ v \f$ for blocks
of any monomer type. 

The requirement that the same monomer reference volume be used for 
all monomer types does not cause any loss of generality in a model 
of polymers as continuous random walks, as long as different values 
may be assigned for the values of the statistical segment lengths 
of different monomer types.  The statistical segment 
\f$ b_{\alpha} \f$ for monomer type \f$ \alpha \f$ is defined to 
be the root-mean-squared distance between the ends of an unperturbed 
random walk of a chemically homogeneoues chain segment of monomer 
type \f$ \alpha \f$ with a molecular weight corresponding to one 
unit of contour length.  The resulting value is generally different 
for different monomer types, even when contour lengths are defined
so that one unit of contour length corresponds to the same volume 
for every monomer type.

There are two common types of convention for block contour lengths
that we refer to here as "experimentalist" and "theorist" conventions.
Both are described below. Experimentalist conventions are generally
the most convenient choice for computational studies that are being
used to predict behavior for a particular experimental system with
blocks of known chemistry and molecular weight. Theorist conventions
are instead more convenient for studies of trends with changes in
parameters, and for studies of phase maps for classes of systems
for which it is known that which predictions of relevant thermodynamic
properties can be parameterized by a small set of dimensionless
parameters.

\anchor user_model_thread_experimentalist
<b> "Experimentalist" Conventions: </b>
In the "experimentalist" convention, a monomer (i.e., a unit of contour
length) is defined for each monomer type so as to correspond to a
segment with a molecular weight chosen so that the volume occupied by 
that segment in a polymer melt is equal to a chosen value for a monomer 
reference volume \f$ v \f$. This is a standard approach used in the 
literature in studies that compare experimental results to predictions 
of the Flory-Huggins theory for polymer solutions and mixtures, the 
random-phase approximation (RPA) theory of small-angle scattering 
and/or to SCFT predictions for inhomogeneous structures.  

In such studies, the reference volume \f$ v \f$ is usually chosen to 
have a value of of order 50 - 100 cubic Angstrom that is comparable to 
the volume of some common hydrocarbon chemical repeat unit containing a
few carbon atoms. Ultimately, however, choice of a value for \f$ v \f$ 
is arbitrary. In a system that contains two or more different types of 
monomer, it generally not possible to choose a single value for the 
reference volume that corresponds to the volume per chemical repeat 
unit of every monomer type, because volumes different types of repeat 
units are generally different. 

The contour length \f$ L \f$ of a chemically homogeneous polymer segment
of some known molecular weight \f$ M \f$ and monomers of type \f$ a \f$
may be expressed as a ratio
\f[
   L  = M/m_{\alpha} \quad,
\f]
in which \f$ m_{\alpha} \f$ is a molecular weight per unit contour length
(or per monomer reference volume) for monomers of type \f$ a \f$. The
quantity \f$ m_{\alpha} \f$ must be defined for each monomer type such
that the volume occupied per chain segment of molecular weight
\f$ m_{\alpha} \f$ in a polymer melt corresponds to the value chosen 
for \f$ v \f$. If a melt of homopolymers containing monomers of type
\f$ \alpha \f$ exhibits a density \f$ \rho_{\alpha} \f$ in grams per
volume at the tempeature and pressure of interest, then the value of
\f$ m_{\alpha} \f$ for that monomer type is given in grams per mole as
\f[
   m_{\alpha} = \rho_{\alpha} v N_{\rm A} \quad
\f]
where \f$ N_{\rm A} \f$ is Avogadro's number. If \f$ \rho_{\alpha} \f$
is given in grams per cubic centimeter and \f$ v \f$ is given in cubic
Angstroms, then a numerical conversion factor of \f$ 10^{-24} \f$ cubic
centimeter per cubic Angstrom is also required to obtain consistent
units.

The value for the statistical segment length \f$ b_{\alpha} \f$ associated
with a specific monomer type is then given by
\f[
   b^{2}_{\alpha} = m \frac{R_{e}^{2}(M)}{M}
\f]
where \f$ R_{e}^{2}(M) \f$ denotes the mean-squared end-to-end length
for a homopolymer chain of molecular weight \f$ M \f$ and monomer type
\f$ \alpha \f$.
Note that the ratio \f$ R_{e}^{2}(M)/M \f$ is independent of molecular
weight for chains with random-walk statistics. If a value for the
statistical segment length is known for some other definition of a
monomer unit (such as a chemical repeat unit, or an effective monomer
defined using a different value for \f$ v \f$ ), then the ratio
\f$ R_{e}^{2}/M \f$ may be replaced by ratio of the square of the
statistical segment length for that monomer definition divided by the
molecular weight per monomer. In experimentalist conventions, Angstrom
or nanometer units are usually used for all lengths.

\anchor user_model_thread_theorist
<b> "Theorist" Conventions </b>:
In a "theorist" convention, contour coordinates are scaled so as to
define the overall contour length of some reference chain or chain segment
to be equal to 1.0 by convention.  The reference chain is often chosen
to correspond to either an entire molecule of some polymer species that
is present in the system, or one block of one such  species.  This is
equivalent to setting the "monomer" reference volume equal to the
occupied volume of the entire reference polymer or block.  Because the
equations implemented by PSCF require that the volume per contour length
must be the same for blocks of different monomer types, values for
ratios of block or chain lengths must be equal to corresponding ratios
of occupied volumes. In this convention, the length assigned to each
block of each polymer must thus be equal to the ratio of the actual
volume of that block to the volume of the reference chain.

For example, in a system that contains a single linear block polymer
species, the length of the entire polymer is often set equal to 1.0 by
convention. In this convention, we  assign the blocks of that polymer
block lengths that are each less than 1 and that add to exactly 1.
In the case of a one-component block polymer melt, the value of each
such block length is then equal to the volume fraction of that block.

The use of theorist convention for contour lengths is compatible
with the use of either physical Angstrom or nanometer length units
or with the use of a convenient system of non-dimensionalized units
for length. The simplest scheme for definining non-dimensionalized
lengths is to define the statistical segment length of one monomer
type to be equal to 1.0 by convention. In this case, one must then
assign every other monomer type a statistical segment length given
by the ratio of its actual statistical segment length (e.g., its
statistical segment length defined using an experimentalist
convention) to that of the reference monomer type. Note that the
values of ratios of statistical segment lengths are unchanged by
changes in one's convention for the monomer reference volume.

All of the examples shown in this user's manual use a theorist convention
in which the overall length of one type of polymer (i.e., the sum of the
length of the blocks for a block polymer) is set to 1.0, and in which the 
statistical segment length of at least one monomer type is set to 1.0. 
This type of convention is also used in the input files for all of the 
examples provided with PSCF.

\subsection user_model_bead_sub Discrete "bead" model

In the "bead", each block of a polymer as a sequence of discrete
beads connected by harmonic springs. In this model, the user must
specify the integer number of beads in each block of the polymer.
Suppose the beads in a block containing \f$ N \f$ beads are indexed
an integer \f$ s 0, \ldots, N-1 \f$. Let \f$ {\bf R}(s) \f$ denote
the position of bead number s.  In this model, a chain segment 
connecting beads \f$ s \f$ and \f$ s' \f$ within a block of monomer 
type \f$ \alpha \f$ is assumed to exhibit a mean-squared end-to-end 
length in a homogeneous system given by
\f[
    \langle |{\bf R}(s) - {\bf R}(s')|^{2} \rangle_{0}
    = [ |s-s'| - 1 ] b_{\alpha}^{2} \quad,
\f]
in which \f$ b_{\alpha} \f$ is a mean-squared length of each 
bond that connects neighboring beads of type \f$ \alpha \f$.  
Similarly to the thread model, all beads are assumed to occupy 
an equal volume given by the monomer volume parameter \f$ v \f$,
which has the same value for all monomer types.

In block polymers composed of monomers with different statistical
segment length, a convention is need for the bond type of the 
"junction" bonds that connect beads belong to neighboring blocks. 
For a linear block polymer in which blocks are labelled with 
indices that start from one end of the polymer, the bond that
the last bead of block \f$ i \f$ to the first bead of block 
\f$ i + 1 \f$ has taken to be a bond of type \f$ i + 1 \f$, 
characterized by a statistical segment length \f$ b_{i+1} \f$. 

PSCF can be used to treat acyclic branched polymers as well as 
linear polymers. When more than two blocks meet at a vertex, PSCF
requires that the vertex bead (the bead that is attached to more 
than two other beads) be "owned" by one of the attached blocks, 
and thus have the same type as other beads in the block that owns 
this vertex bead. For simplicity, such a vertex bead is thus 
required to have a monomer type that corresponds to that of one 
of the attached blocks. A bond that attaches a vertex bead to 
the first bead of a block that does not contain the vertex bead
is taken to have a bond type given by the type of the bead that 
is not part of the same block as the vertex bead.

A junction between two blocks in a linear polymer is treated as 
a special type of vertex. In this case, ownership of the vertex 
bead is treated by the by convention described above: By default, 
the last bead of each block in a linear block polymer is treated 
as a vertex bead.

\section user_model_solvent_sec Solvent species

PSCF allows user to model polymer solutions by including zero or more
"solvent" species in addition to one or more polymer species. Each
solvent molecule is treated as a mobile but structureless point-like
particle that occupies some volume within an incompressible mixture.
Solvent species can be used to model either rigid small-molecule
solvent molecules or oligomeric chain molecules that much shorter
than all of the "polymer" species present in the same system.

Each solvent species is assigned a monomer type that is selected from
among the same set of monomer types that can be used to describe
polymer blocks. A solvent that has properties that are distinct from
those of any of the monomers used to construct the polymer species can
be assigned an extra monomer type that is simply not used as the
monomer type for any polymer block. A solvent species can instead
be assigned a mononer type that is the same as that assigned to
one or block polymer blocks if that solvent species represents a
small oligomer of the specified monomer type, or another species
with physical properties very similar to those of such an oligomer.
The input file format for PSCF requires that a monomer type that
this is only associated with a solvent species must must still be
assigned a statistical segment length value, but in this case that
segment length value is simply left unused.

Each solvent species is also assigned a volume per molecule. This
is specified in the PSCF input files by a dimensionless parameter
labelled "size". The value of the size parameter is equal to the
ratio of the solvent volume to that of a the mononer reference
volume. The "size" parameter for a solvent species is thus closely
analogous to the "length" parameter for a polymer block, since
both are defined as volumes measured in units of the monomer
reference volume.

If one describes a polymer solution using "theorist" units in which
the reference volume it defined to be equal to the total volume of
some reference polymer species, then values for the solvent size
parameter will usually much less than 1.0. Thus for example, a system
with a homopolymer of length 1.0 and a solvent with a size equal to
0.01 could be used to describe a homopolymer solution in which the
polymer volume is 100 times greater than that of the solvent.  It
is also valid, and sometimes more convenient, to describe a solution
using a theorist convention in which the volume of the solvent species
is taken as the reference volume. In this case, the solvent size wil
be set equal to 1.0 by convention, and the lengths for polymer blocks
will generally be much greater than 1.

\section user_model_vMonomer_sec Irrelevance of monomer volume in SCFT

A value for the monomer reference volume \f$ \f$ is not required 
as an input to a standard SCFT calculation.  As discussed 
\ref user_model_continuous_sec "above", when using a model that idealizes 
polymers as continuous chains to analyze a specific experimental system, 
the choice of a convention for the monomer reference volume \f$ v \f$ 
determines the appropriate choice of values for several types of related 
parameters, such as the block lengths, monomer statistical segment 
lengths, and interaction parameters. It turns out, however, that once 
the values of these related parameters are determined, the value of 
\f$ v \f$ itself is not needed as an additional independent input to an 
SCFT calculation.  It can be shown that changes in the value of \f$ v \f$ 
alone, without corresponding changes in the values assigned to related 
parameters (e.g., statistical segment lengths, block lengths and chi 
parameters) have no effect on SCFT predictions for values of any of 
the properties normally output by the PSCF programs. Specifically, 
changes in the value of \f$ v \f$ alone can be shown to have no effect 
on SCFT predictions for average monomer volume fraction fields, polymer 
or solvent chemical potential values, or the non-dimensionalized SCFT
Helmholtz free energy that is reported by PSCF in its standard format 
for outputting SCFT \ref scft_thermo_page "thermodynamic properties", 
which is a dimensionless free energy per monomer.

The role of \f$ v \f$ in SCFT is discussed in more detail in a separate 
discussion of the \ref scft_theory_page "working equations for SCFT".
There we show explicitly that the forms of these equations implemented 
in PSCF simply do not require a value for \f$ v \f$ as an independent
input parameter.

A value for \f$ v \f$ is, however, always required as an independent
input parameter for stochastic FTS calculations. If all other parameters
are held fixed, smaller values for \f$ v \f$ lead to less overlap 
among polymers, and weaker field fluctuations. In systems with a
single species of chain length \f$ N \f$ and a single statistical
segment length \f$ b \f$, the extent of overlap and the magnitude
of fluctuations can be characterized by a dimensionless parameter
\f$ \overline{N} = N (b^{3}/v)^2 \f$ known as the invariant degree
of polymerization.  SCFT predictions are recovered in the limit 
\f$\overline{N} \rightarrow \infty\f$ or, equivalenty, in the limit 
\f$ v \rightarrow \infty \f$.
