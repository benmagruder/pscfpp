PSCF solves self-consistent field theory (SCFT) equations for an 
incompressible mixture of any number of block polymer species and point-like 
solvent molecular species.

In what follows, let \f$ C \f$ be the number of distinct monomer or solvent
types in the system. Let \f$ P \f$ denote the number of polymer species and
\f$ S\f$ be the number of solvent species.  Here, we use a convention in
which integer indices \f$ \alpha, \beta = 1, \ldots, C\f$ indicate monomer
types, and indices \f$ i, j\f$ denote molecular species.  Species indices
are ordered with all polymeric species listed first, so that species index
values in the range \f$ i, j = 1, \ldots, P\f$ denote polymeric species,
and values in the range \f$ P+1,\ldots, P+S \f$ denote solvent species.

\section user_theory_scf_sec Self-Consistent Field Equations

SCFT for a liquid of flexible polymers is based on a mean-field
approximation that allows us to predict properties of an interacting
liquid by considering considering the behavior of a corresponding gas of
noninteracting molecules in a spatially inhomogeneous chemical potential
landscape. In what follows, let \f$ k_{B}Tw_{\alpha}(\textbf{r}) \f$
denote the chemical potential field for monomers of type \f$ \alpha\f$ ,
which gives the free energy cost of placing such a monomer at location
\f$ \textbf{r} \f$ . Let \f$ \phi_{\alpha}(\textbf{r}) \f$ denote the
corresponding average volume fraction of monomers of type \f$ \alpha \f$
at position \f$ \textbf{r} \f$ .

The monomer chemical potential fields are given, within the standard
approximation for excess free energies in terms of binary Flory-Huggins
interaction parameters, as functions
\f[
   w_{\alpha}(\textbf{r}) = \sum_{\beta = 1}^{C}
   \chi_{\alpha\beta} \phi_{\beta}(\textbf{r}) + \xi(\textbf{r})
\f]
in which \f$ \chi_{\alpha\beta} \f$ is a binary interaction parameter
for interactions between monomers of types \f$ \alpha\f$ and \f$ \beta\f$ ,
for which \f$ \chi_{\alpha\beta} = \chi_{\beta\alpha} \f$ ,
and \f$ \xi(\textbf{r}) \f$ is a Lagrange multiplier pressure field.

The Lagrange multiplier field \f$ \xi(\textbf{r})\f$ must be chosen such
that the monomer concentrations satisfy the incompressibility constraint
\f[
   1 = \sum_{\alpha=1}^{C} \phi_{\alpha}(\textbf{r}) \quad.
\f]

\section user_theory_polymer_sec Polymer Species

Each polymer species in a system modelled by PSCF must be a block polymer 
consisting of blocks connected at junction points. Homopolymers are treated
as a special case of a block polymer with only one block.  Let \f$ B_{i} \f$ 
denote the number of blocks in block polymer species number \f$ i \f$.

Each block within a block polymer connects two vertices. Each such vertex 
is either a junction to which two or more blocks are connected or a chain end
to which only one block is attached.  In the language of graph theory, every 
allowed polymer structure thus corresponds to an acyclic connected graph 
(also known as a tree) with some number of "edges" (or blocks) and "nodes" 
(or vertices).  A standard theorem of graph theory tells us that a connected 
acyclic branched polymer (or graph) with \f$ B_{i} \f$ blocks or edges must 
have exactly \f$ B_{i} + 1 \f$ vertices or nodes.

PSCF assigns each block within a polymer species \f$ i \f$ with \f$ B_{i} \f$ 
blocks an integer index in the range \f$ [0, \ldots, B_{i}-1 ]\f$, and 
assigns each vertex (each junction or chain end) an index value in the 
range \f$ [ 0, \ldots, B_{i} ]\f$.  By convention, we use index variables 
\f$ a \f$ and \f$ b \f$ for block identifiers.
The structure of a polymer can thus be characterized by assigning each
block a monomer type, a contour length, and a pair of integer ids for the 
two vertices to which the block is attached. The length of each block is 
given by the ratio of the volume occupied by the block to the value of a 
monomer reference volume. Let \f$ L_{ai} \f$ denote the length of block 
\f$ a \f$ of polymer species \f$ i \f$.

\subsection user_theory_propagator_sub Propagator Functions

For each block, we define two "propagator" functions, denoted generically
by \f$ q( \textbf{r}, s) \f$, each of which is associated with one of the
two directions in which the block may be traversed.  Each propagator is
said to originate at one of the two vertices to which the associated block 
is attached and terminate at the other. The contour variable parameter 
\f$ s \f$ is defined for each propagator \f$ q(\textbf{r},s) \f$ such that 
\f$ s = 0 \f$ at the vertex at which the propagator originates and 
\f$ s = L \f$ at the vertex at which the propagator terminates, where
\f$ L \f$ is the contour length of the block. When we need to distinguish
between the propagators associated with a single block, we will sometimes
refer to them instead as \f$ q \f$ and \f$ q^{\dagger} \f$, though the
choice of which is referred to as \f$ q \f$ and which \f$ q^{\dagger} \f$
is arbitrary.

For each vertex that is connected to \f$ M \f$ blocks, there are \f$ M \f$ 
propagators that originate at that vertex, which we refer to the "outgoing" 
propagators for that vertex, and \f$ M \f$ propagators that terminate at 
that vertex, which we refer to as "incoming" propagators. 

Imagine a process in which break the connection between two vertices of
a block polymer that are attached to opposite ends of the same bond by
cutting that block at a specific contour coordinate within the block. 
Cutting any block within an acyclic branched block polymer in this way 
always divide the polymer into two disconnected pieces. This property is 
one way of defining what we mean when we describe a polymer topology as 
"acyclic": In acyclic polymer, there are no closed cycles that connect 
any vertices by two or more distinct paths, and so there is thus exactly 
one path that connects any two vertices within the same connected polymer. 
Cutting any block within such a polymer divides the vertices of the 
polymer into two disconnected subsets, and thus breaks the polymer into 
two disconnected pieces.

Each propagator has a simple physical interpretation as a normalized
constrained partitition function for one of the two segments of polymer 
that would be created by cutting the bond along which the propagator 
is defined.  
Let \f$ q(\textbf{r}, s) \f$ denote a propagator that originates at 
vertex \f$ A \f$ of a block of length \f$ L \f$ that connects vertices 
\f$ A \f$ and \f$ B \f$ within an acylic block polymer.
Let \f$ q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r}, L-s) \f$ denote the propagator that is 
associated with the same block but that originates at vertex \f$ B \f$.
Let \f$ Z(\textbf{r}, s)\f$ denote the constrained partition function 
of the polymer segment containing vertex \f$ A \f$ that would be 
created by cutting that block at contour coordinate \f$ s \f$, subject 
to a constraint that the location of the free end that was created by 
cutting that bond be constrained to a specified position \f$\textbf{r}\f$,
while the position of every other point in that segment of polymer is
free to fluctuate. 
This constrained partition function for a branched polymer segment 
can be defined in a model with discrete point-like beads connected 
by bonds as an integral of the appropriate Boltzmann weight for this 
segment, integrated with respect the positions of all beads in this 
segment except an end-bead at coordinate \f$ s \f$ within the bond 
that was cut, whose position is treated as a fixed parameter with a 
value \f$ \textbf{r} \f$.  
The value \f$ q(\textbf{r}, s) \f$ is defined to be proportional 
to \f$ Z(\textbf{r}, s) \f$ with an \f$ \textbf{r} \f$ - independent 
constant of proportionality that is defined such that we obtain
\f$ q(\textbf{r}, s) = 1 \f$ for all \f$ \textbf{r} \f$ in the 
special case of vanishing external potentials, in which the potentials
\f$ w_{1}(\textbf{r}), \ldots, w_{C}(\textbf{r}) \f$ all vanish for 
all \f$ \textbf{r} \f$ in the domain of interest.
The complementary propagator \f$ q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r}, L-s) \f$ 
for such a bond is instead proportional to the constrained partition 
function of the other segment of polymer that is created by cutting 
this bond, which must contain vertex \f$ B \f$, subject to a 
constraint that the newly created free end of that segment be 
constrained to the specified position \f$ \textbf{r} \f$.

The product of \f$ q(\textbf{r},s) q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r},L-s) \f$ 
of the two propagators associated with a bond is proportional to the
constrained partition function of the entire polymer, subject to a
constraint requiring that the monomer at contour coordinate \f$ s \f$
within this bond be constrained to a position \f$ \textbf{r} \f$.
The probability that this point within the polymer would have this
position in an equilibrated system containing a single chain is 
proportional to this constrained partition function. 
We thus conclude that the product 
\f$ q(\textbf{r},s) q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r},L-s) \f$ is proportional
to the equilibrium probability density for the position of this 
monomer for a system containing single chain subjected to a set of
inhomogeneous potentials. 

\subsection user_theory_mde_sub Modified Diffusion Equation

Each propagator \f$ q(\textbf{r}, s) \f$ associated with a block of 
monomer type \f$ \alpha \f$ can be shown to obey a partial 
differential equation 
\f[
  \frac{\partial q}{\partial s} =  -H_{\alpha}q_{i}
\f]
in which \f$ H_{\alpha} \f$ is a linear diferential operator
\f[
  H_{\alpha} = -\frac{b_{\alpha}^{2}}{6}\nabla^{2}
             + w_{\alpha}(\textbf{r})
\f]
in which \f$ b_{\alpha} \f$ is the statistical segment length 
for monomers of type \f$ \alpha \f$ , and \f$ w_{\alpha}\f$ is 
the SCF chemical potential field for \f$ \alpha \f$ monomers, 
in thermal energy units. We refer to this as the modified 
diffusion equation (MDE). Numerical solution of the MDE is the
most computationally expensive operation in any SCFT program.

The initial condition for propagators that originate at a chain end 
requires that
\f[
   q(\textbf{r},s=0) = 1
\f]
for all \f$ \textbf{r} \f$ in the relevant spatial domain.

The initial value \f$ q(\textbf{r}, s=0) \f$ of an outgoing propagator 
that originates at a junction that connects \f$ M \f$ blocks is given
by a pointwise product of values of the \f$ M - 1 \f$ incoming 
propagators for that junction that are associated with blocks other 
than the block associated with the outgoing propagator of interest, 
in which the incoming propagators are all evaluated at the same 
position \f$ \textbf{r} \f$.  

In the simple case of a linear polymer, for which every junction 
connects two blocks, the initial condition for the each outgoing 
propagator that originates at a junction is simply equal to the 
final value of the incoming propagator associated with the other 
block that is attached to that junction. Consider a linear polymer
with \f$ B \f$ blocks in which blocks and vertices are indexed 
sequentially by their position relative to one of the chain.
Let \f$ L_{i} \f$ denote the length of block \f$ i \f$, which 
connects vertices \f$ i \f$ and \f$ i + 1 \f$.
Let \f$ q_{i} \f$ denotes the propagator in block \f$ i \f$ that 
originates at vertex \f$ i \f$, and let \f$ q_{i}^{\dagger} \f$ 
denotes the propagator in block \f$ i \f$ that originates at 
vertex \f$ i+1 \f$. With this notation,
\f$ q_{i+1}(\textbf{r},0) = q_{i}(\textbf{r},L_{i}) \f$ and
\f$ q_{i}^{\dagger}(\textbf{r},0)= q_{i+1}^{\dagger}(\textbf{r},L_{i+1})\f$ 
for  \f$ i = 0, \ldots, B - 2 \f$.

As an example of a branched polymer, consider the case of a three 
armed star containing blocks with indices 0, 1 and 2 that are all
connected at a central junction.  Let \f$ L_{a} \f$ denote the 
length of block \f$ a \f$.  Let \f$ q_{a}(\textbf{r},s)\f$ denote the 
propagator in block \f$ a \f$ that originates at the central junction, 
and let \f$ q_{a}^{\dagger}(\textbf{r},s) \f$ denote the propagator in 
block \f$ a \f$ that originates at a free end and terminates at the 
central junction.  The initial condition for propagators that originate 
at chain ends requires that \f$ q_{a}^{\dagger}(\textbf{r},s=0) = 1 \f$
for all \f$ \textbf{r} \f$ and all \f$a\f$. The initial condition for 
the outgoing propagator in block 0 is then given by, for example, by
\f[
    q_{0}(\textbf{r}, s=0) = 
    q_{1}^{\dagger}(\textbf{r}, L_1) 
    q_{2}^{\dagger}(\textbf{r}, L_2) \quad.
\f]
Initial conditions for \f$ q_{1} \f$ and \f$ q_{2} \f$ are analogous.

In the pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs, the MDE for propagators in a 
periodic structure is solved within a single unit cell, subject to 
periodic boundary conditions. 

In the pscf_fd program, the MDE for each propagator \f$ q(x,s) \f$ is 
solved within a range of values of the single spatial coordinate 
\f$ x \f$, where \f$ x \f$ may represent either a Cartesian normal
coordinate for a system with the geometry of a flat film or a radial
coordinate for a system with cylindrical or spherical symmetry. 
In the case of a problem that is defined in cylindrical or 
spherical coordinates with a domain that includes \f$ x = 0\f$, we 
must require that \f$ \partial q/\partial x = 0 \f$ at \f$ x = 0 \f$ 
in order to avoid introducing gradient discontinuities at the 
origin of space. In most foreseeable applications of this program, 
one or both of the limits of the computational domain is intended 
to represent a point that lies deep within homogeneous region, 
such as bulk region surrounding a micelle or a bulk phase far 
from an interface. In these cases, it is also appropriate to set
\f$ \partial q/\partial x = 0 \f$ at these boundaries. In light of
these considerations, the pscf_fd is designed to apply boundary
conditions requiring that \f$ \partial q/\partial x = 0 \f$ at 
both upper and lower limiting values of \f$ x \f$.

\subsection user_theory_products_sub Spatial Integrals of Propagator Products

The above discussion of the physical interpretation of propagator 
functions implies that the probability of finding a specific monomer 
that is located a contour distance \f$ s \f$ from one of the two 
vertices that are connected by a block located at a specified 
position \f$ \textbf{r} \f$ is proportional to the product
\f[
     q(\textbf{r},s) q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r},L-s) \quad,
\f]
in which we have used \f$ q \f$ and \f$ q^{\dagger} \f$ to denote the
two propagators associated with that block. In the above expression, we
have arbitrarily defined \f$ s \f$ to be the contour distance measured 
from the vertex at which \f$ q(\textbf{r},s) \f$ originates, while 
\f$ L \f$ denotes the length of the block.

It is straightforward to show that the value of the product
\f$ q q^{\dagger}\f$ at \f$ s=0 \f$, corresponding to value at the vertex 
at which \f$ q \f$ originates, is also equal to the product of the final 
values of all the incoming propagators for this vertex.
To show this, note that \f$ q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r},s=0) \f$ is the final
value for the incoming propagator associated with the block of interest,
while the initial condition for \f$ q \f$ requires that its value at
\f$ s=0 \f$ be equal to the product of the final values of incoming
propagators associated with all other blocks (if any) that are attached
to that vertex.  If \f$ q \f$ originates at a chain end, then
\f$q(\textbf{r}, s) = 1\f$, and so this product simply yields the value
of the one incoming propagagator \f$ q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r}, s) \f$ at
that chain end. By applying similar reasoning to the vertex at which
\f$ q^{\dagger} \f$ originates and \f$q\f$ terminates, we may show that
the value of the product \f$ q q^{\dagger} \f$ at \f$s=L\f$ must equal
the product of final values of all of the incoming propagators for this
vertex.

Consider the integral the behavior of the spatial integral
\f[
   I(s) \equiv
   \int d\textbf{r} \; q (\textbf{r},s) q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r},L-s)
\f]
evaluated at a fixed contour coordinate \f$ s \f$ within some specified
block, where the integral is taken over the entire spatial domain for
the model of interest.  It is straightforward to show that the value of
\f$ I(s)\f$ is actually independent of the the value of the the contour
coordinate \f$ s \f$. To show this, note that
\f{eqnarray*}
  \frac{dI(s)}{ds} & = & \frac{d}{ds}
  \int d\textbf{r} \;
  q (\textbf{r},s) q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r},L-s) \\
  & = &
  \int d\textbf{r} \;  \left \{
  \frac{\partial q (\textbf{r},s)}{\partial s}
  q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r},L-s)
  - q (\textbf{r},s)
  \frac{\partial q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r},L-s)}{\partial s}
  \right \} \\
  & = &
  \int d\textbf{r} \;  \left \{
  [ \hat{H} q (\textbf{r},s) ] q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r},L-s)
  - q (\textbf{r},s) [\hat{H} q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r},L-s)]
  \right \}
  \quad.
\f}
We may then use the fact that the operator \f$ \hat{H} \f$ (like the
analogous quantum mechanical Hamiltonian operator for a particle
in a potential) can be shown to be a self-adjoint or Hermitian
differential operator to show that the two terms in the right-hand-side
of the last line of the above equation must cancel, giving
\f[
    dI(s)/ds = 0 \quad.
\f]
The fact that the value of this integral is independent of \f$ s \f$
within each block also implies that it must have the same value in
the limits \f$ s=0 \f$ and \f$ s=L \f$, corresponding to its values at
the two attached vertices. Combining this with our previous observations,
we find that the spatial integral of the product of incoming propagators
must have the same value at any two vertices that are directly attached
by a block.  Because all vertices in a polymer are connected by some
sequence of blocks, this implies that the value of this spatial
integral must be the same for every vertex in any acyclic branched
polymer.

\subsection user_theory_bigQ_sub Molecular Partition Function

Let \f$ Q_{i} \f$ denote a normalized single-chain partition function
for a polymer molecule of species \f$ i \f$ in a specified set of
effective monomer potential fields. We define the value of this quantity
to be given by the spatial average (i.e., the integral over the entire
spatial domain of the problem divided by the volume of this domain) of
the product of the values of the incoming propagators evaluated at a
vertex of the polymer. The above discussion implies that we should get
the same value for this quantity by evaluating it using any vertex in
a polymer. A particularly compact expression for this quantity may be
obtained by evaluating it at any chain end, for which we obtain
\f[
   Q_{i} = \frac{1}{V} \int \! d\textbf{r} \; q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r},L)
\f]
where \f$q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r}, L)\f$ denotes the final value of
the single incoming propagator at that chain end, where \f$ L \f$
is the length of the attached block. Here, the integral is taken
over the entire spatial domain for the problem of interest, while
\f$ V \f$ is the generalized volume of that domain. In the the case
of a periodic structure, the required spatial average may be evaluated
by evaluating the integral over one crystallographic unit cell and
then dividing by the generalized volume of that unit cell  (i.e., the
volume per unit cell for a 3D crystal, area per 2D unit cell for a 2D
structure such as a hexagonal cylinder phase, or the length per unit
cell in a 1D lamellar phase).

\subsection user_theory_phi_sub Block Volume Fractions

Let \f$ \phi_{ai}(\textbf{r})\f$ denote the local volume fraction of
monomers belonging to block \f$ a \f$ of polymer species \f$ i \f$.
This quantity is given by a product
\f[
   \phi_{a i}(\textbf{r}) =
   \frac{\overline{\phi}_{i}}{L_{i}Q_{i}}
   \int\limits_{0}^{L_{ai}} \! ds \;
    q(\textbf{r},s) q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r},s)
\f]
in which \f$ \overline{\phi}_{i}\f$ is the average overall volume
fraction of molecule species \f$ i \f$ within the mixture, \f$ L_{ai} \f$
is the contour length of the block of interest, and \f$ L_{i} \f$ is the
sum of the contour lengths of all of the blocks of species \f$ i \f$.

The total volume fraction \f$ \phi_{\alpha}(\textbf{r}) \f$ for each
monomer type \f$ \alpha\f$ is simply the sum of volume fractions for all 
polymer blocks and all solvent species that contain monomers of of type 
\f$ \alpha\f$ .

\section user_theory_solvent_sec Solvent Species

Each solvent species \f$ i\f$ is associated with a specific monomer type 
\f$ \alpha\f$ and a dimensionaless "size" parameter. The size parameter
for a solvent is a measure of volume closely analogous to the length
parameter for a block in a block polymer, and is equal to the ratio of
the volume per molecule occupied by the solvent to the monomomer reference
volume. In light of this analogy, we denote the "size" of solvent \f$ i\f$
here by \f$ L_{i} \f$.

In the single molecule problem for solvent species, the free energy 
penalty for a solvent molecule of monomer type \f$ \alpha\f$ to be 
located at position \f$ \textbf{r} \f$ is given by 
\f$ k_{B}T L_{i} w_{\alpha}(\textbf{r}) \f$ .
This implies the existence of a solvent volume fraction field
\f$ \phi_{i}(\textbf{r}) \propto \exp(-L_{i}w_{\alpha}(\textbf{r})) \f$ .

We define a normalized molecular partition function \f$ Q_{i} \f$ for 
solvent species \f$ i \f$ that is given by an integral
\f[
   Q_{i} = \frac{1}{V}
   \int \! d\textbf{r} \; \exp (-L_{i}w_{\alpha}(\textbf{r}) )
\f]
for all \f$ i = P + 1, \ldots, P + S \f$ .
The local volume fraction \f$ \phi_{i}(\textbf{r}) \f$ for solvent 
species \f$ i \f$ is then given by a ratio
\f[
   \phi_{i}(\textbf{r}) =
   \frac{\overline{\phi}_{i}}{Q_{i}}
   \exp(-L_{i}w_{\alpha}(\textbf{r}))
\f]
in which \f$ \overline{\phi}_{i} \f$ is the overall volume fraction of 
solvent species \f$ i \f$ within the mixture.

\section user_theory_ensemble_sec Open and Closed Ensembles

PSCF allows the user to choose either an open or closed statistical
ensemble for each molecular species in the mixture, by allowing a
user to enter a value for either the overall volume fraction for 
that species, denoted here by \f$ \overline{\phi}_{i} \f$, or a 
value for the chemical potential, denoted here by \f$ \mu_{i} \f$. 

To use an open ensemble for a particular species SCFT, one uses an 
open (i.e., grand-canonical) ensemble to treat the behavior of that
species when considering the hypothetical ideal gas of non-interacting 
molecules subjected to a potential. Use of a of grand-canonical 
ensemble to describe to a gas of molecules of species \f$ i \f$ 
yields an overall concentration for that species and a corresponding 
overall volume fraction \f$ \overline{\phi}_{i} \f$ that are both 
proportional to the product \f$ e^{\beta\mu_{i}} Q_{i} \f$. The value
of the constants of proportionality in the expressions depends upon 
arbitrary choices of convention for normalizing volume used to relate
the configurational integral for a single chain to a dimensionless
partition function and a choice of reference state used to define 
the chemical potential. In the equations used in PSCF, we set
\f[
   \overline{\phi}_{i} = e^{\mu_{i}/k_{B} T} Q_{i} \quad,
\f]
as a matter of convention. 

Calculations of the local volume fractions for monomers with a 
specific block of a block copolymer and for the local volume fraction
of a solvent species are thus performed for molecular species that
are treated in an open ensemble, by simply replacing the parameter 
\f$ \overline{\phi}_{i} \f$ by the above expression in all expressions
that involve \f$ \overline{\phi}_{i} \f$.

The value of the chemical potential is computed for any species that 
is treated in a closed ensemble (i.e., any species for which a volume 
fraction is specified in the parameter file) by computing
\f[
   \frac{\mu_{i}}{k_{B}T } 
   = \ln \left ( \overline{\phi}_{i} / Q_{i}  \right )
   \quad,
\f]
after computing \f$ Q_{i} \f$.

Values of species chemical potentials in both input and output files 
used by PSCF, which are denoted indicated the label "mu", are given in
thermal energy units, and thus are correspond to values of the ratio
\f$ \mu_{i}/k_{B}T \f$.

\section user_theory_thermo_sec Thermodynamic Properties

PSCF reports values of the Helmholtz free energy and the pressure in
non-dimensionalized form.

The SCFT prediction for the total Helmholtz free energy \f$ F \f$ can be 
expressed as a sum
\f[
    F = F_{\rm id} + F_{\rm int}
\f]
where \f$ F_{\rm id} \f$ is a "ideal" contribution that arises from polymer 
configurational entropy, and \f$ F_{\rm int} \f$ is an "interaction" 
contribution that arises directly from excess free energy of interaction
that is characterized here in terms of binary interaction parameters. 
The ideal and interaction contributions to the free energy per monomer 
reference volume \f$ F v /k_{B}T \f$, as reported in output files, are 
given by
\f{eqnarray*}
    \frac{F_{\rm id} v}{Vk_{B}T} 
    & = & \sum_{i=1}^{P+S} \frac{\overline{\phi}_{i}}{L_{i}}
    \left [ \ln ( \overline{\phi}_{i} / Q_{i} ) - 1 \right ] 
     - \frac{1}{V}
       \sum_{\alpha=1}^{C}
       \int \! d\textbf{r} \;
       w_{\alpha}(\textbf{r})
      \phi_{\alpha}(\textbf{r}) \\
   \frac{F_{\rm int} v}{Vk_{B}T} 
     & = &  \frac{1}{2V} \sum_{\alpha, \beta =1}^{C}  
     \chi_{\alpha\beta} \int \! d\textbf{r} \; 
     \phi_{\alpha}(\textbf{r}) \phi_{\beta}(\textbf{r})
\f}
Note that the sum over species in the first term in the definition 
of \f$ F_{\rm id} \f$ is a sum over all species, including polymeric 
and solvent species. Unified notation for both types of molecule has
been made possible by using the symbol \f$ L_{i} \f$ to denote both 
the overall length per molecule for polymer species (the sum of the 
lengths of all blocks) and to denote the "size" parameter for 
solvent species.

The macroscopic physical pressure \f$ P \f$ is computed from the identity
\f[
    P = - \frac{F}{V}
        + \sum_{i=1}\frac{\mu_{i}\overline{\phi}_{i}}{N_{i}v}
\f]
in which \f$ F / V \f$ is the Helmholtz free energy density and
\f$ \overline{\phi}_{i}/(N_{i}v) \f$ is the average number of molecules
of species \f$ i \f$ per unit volume. The value given in the output file
is the dimensionless value \f$ Pv/k_{B}T \f$ .

In grand-canonical ensemble, values for the Lagrange multplier
field \f$ \xi(\textbf{r}) \f$ and the macroscopic pressure \f$ P\f$
are uniquely determined by the values for the chemical potentials.

In canonical ensemble, the value of the Lagrange multplier field
\f$ \xi(\textbf{r}) \f$ is defined only to within a arbitrary
spatially homogeneous constant. As a result, the chemical potentials
and the macroscopic pressure \f$ P \f$ are also undefined in this
ensemble, unless an additional constraint is imposed. PSCF resolves
this ambiguity by requiring, as a matter of convention, that the
spatial average of \f$ \xi(\textbf{r}) \f$ vanish. In this ensemble,
PSCF also outputs values for the pressure, chemical potentials, and
\f$ w \f$ fields that are all consistent with this convention
for the average value of \f$ \xi \f$ . Values for the Hemholtz free
energy density of an incompressible liquid can, however, be shown
to be independent of changes in the value of \f$ \xi \f$ by a
homogeneous constant, and are thus independent of this choice of
convention.
