PSCF solves self-consistent field theory (SCFT) equations for an 
incompressible mixture of any number of block copolymer species and 
point-like solvent molecular species. 

In what follows, let \f$ C \f$ be the number of distinct monomer or solvent 
types in the system. Let \f$ P\f$ denote the number of polymer species and 
\f$ S\f$ be the number of solvent species.  Here, we use a convention in 
which integer indices \f$ \alpha, \beta = 1, \ldots, C\f$ indicate monomer 
types, and indices \f$ i, j\f$ denote molecular species.  Species indices 
are ordered with all polymeric species listed first, so that species index 
values in the range \f$ i, j = 1, \ldots, P\f$ denote polymeric species, 
and values in the range \f$ P+1,\ldots, P+S \f$ denote solvent species.

\section user_theory_scf_sec Self-Consistent Field Equations

SCFT for a liquid of flexible polymers is based on a mean-field 
approximation that allows us to predict properties of an interacting 
liquid by considering considering the behavior of a corresponding gas of 
noninteracting molecules in a spatially inhomogeneous chemical potential 
landscape. In what follows, let \f$ k_{B}Tw_{\alpha}(\textbf{r})\f$ 
denote the chemical potential field for monomers of type \f$ \alpha\f$ , 
which gives the free energy cost of placing such a monomer at location
\f$ \textbf{r}\f$ . Let \f$ \phi_{\alpha}(\textbf{r})\f$ denote the
corresponding average volume fraction of monomers of type \f$ \alpha\f$ 
at position \f$ \textbf{r} \f$ .

The monomer chemical potential fields are given, within the standard 
approximation for excess free energies in terms of binary Flory-Huggins 
interaction parameters, as functions
\f[
   w_{\alpha}(\textbf{r}) = \sum_{\beta = 1}^{C}
   \chi_{\alpha\beta} \phi_{\beta}(\textbf{r}) + \xi(\textbf{r})
\f]
in which \f$ \chi_{\alpha\beta} \f$ is a binary interaction parameter 
for interactions between monomers of types \f$ \alpha\f$ and \f$ \beta\f$ ,
for which \f$ \chi_{\alpha\beta} = \chi_{\beta\alpha}\f$ ,
and \f$ \xi(\textbf{r}) \f$ is a Lagrange multiplier pressure field.  

The Lagrange multiplier field \f$ \xi(\textbf{r})\f$ must be chosen such 
that the monomer concentrations satisfy the incompressibility constraint
\f[
   1 = \sum_{\alpha=1}^{C} \phi_{\alpha}(\textbf{r}) \quad.
\f]

\section user_theory_polymer_sec Polymer Species

Each polymer within mixture that can be treated by PSCF must be an acyclic 
branched block polymer constructed by connecting blocks at junctions.  
Linear polymers are treated as a special case of acyclic branched polymers. 
Homopolymers are treated as a special case of polymer with only one block.
Let \f$ B_{i} \f$ denote the number of blocks in block polymer species 
number \f$ i \f$.  

Each block within such a block polymer polymer connects two vertices. 
Each such vertex is either a chain end that is attached to a single block 
or a junction at which two or more blocks are connected. In the language 
of graph theory, every allowed polymer structure thus corresponds to an 
acyclic connected graph (also known as a tree) with some number of "edges" 
(or blocks) and "nodes" (or vertices).  A standard theorem tells us that 
a connected acyclic branched polymer (or graph) with \f$ B_{i} \f$ blocks 
or edges must have exactly \f$ B_{i} + 1 \f$ vertices or nodes.

PSCF assigns each block with a polymer with \f$ B \f$ blocks an integer
index in the range \f$ [0, \ldots, B-1 ]\f$, and each vertex (i.e.,
junction or chain end) and index in the range \f$ [ 0, \ldots, B ]\f$.
By convention, we use indices \f$ a \f$ and \f$ b \f$ for block indices.
The structure of a polymer can thus be characterized by assigning each
block a monomer type, a contour length, and an integer ids for the two
vertices at which the ends of the block terminate. The length of each
block is given by the ratio of the volume occupied by the block to 
the value of a monomer reference volume. Let \f$ L_{ai} \f$ denote 
the length of block \f$ a \f$ of polymer species \f$ i \f$. 

\subsection user_theory_polymer_sub Modified Diffusion Equation

For each block, we define two "propagator" functions, denoted generically 
by \f$ q( \textbf{r}, s) \f$, that are functions functions of position 
\f$ \textbf{r} \f$ and a contour variable \f$ s \f$, each of which is 
associated with one of the two directions in which the block may be 
traversed. Each propgator may thus be said to originate at one of the 
two vertices to which the associated block is connected and terminate 
at the other attached vertex. The contour variable parameter \f$ s \f$ 
is defined for each propagator \f$ q(\textbf{r},s) \f$ such that 
\f$ s = 0 \f$ at the vertex at which the propagator originates and 
\f$ s = L \f$ at the vertex at which the propagator terminates, where 
\f$ L \f$ is the contour length of the block. When we need to distinguish 
between the propagators associated with a single block, we will sometimes 
refer to them instead as \f$ q \f$ and \f$ q^{\dagger} \f$. 

Each such propagator obeys partial differential equation that we refer 
to as the modified diffusion equation (MDE):
\f[

  \frac{\partial q}{\partial s} =  -H_{\alpha}q_{i} 

\f]
in which \f$ \alpha\f$ is the monomer type of the associated block, 
and \f$ H_{\alpha}\f$ is a linear diferential operator
\f[

  H_{\alpha} = -\frac{b_{\alpha}^{2}}{6}\nabla^{2} 
             + w_{\alpha}(\textbf{r})

\f]
in which \f$ b_{\alpha} \f$ is the statistical segment length for 
monomers of type \f$ \alpha \f$ , and \f$ w_{\alpha}\f$ is the 
corresponding self-consistent chemical potential field in thermal
energy units.

For each vertex that is connected to \f$ M \f$ blocks, there are
\f$ M \f$ propagators that originate at that vertex, which we
refer to as "outgoing" propagators, and \f$ M \f$ propagators
that terminate at that vertex, which we refer to as "incoming" 
propagators. A chain end is vertex that is only connected to one 
block, whereas junction is a vertex that is connected to  two or 
more different blocks.

The initial condition for propagators that originate at a chain
end requires that
\f[
   q(\textbf{r},s=0) = 1
\f]
throughout the spatial domain of the problem of interest.

The initial condition for any propagator that originates at a 
junction requires instead that \f$ q(\textbf{r}, s) \f$ is equal 
to the pointwise product of values of incoming propagators associated 
with other blocks that terminate at the same junction. The product of 
incoming propagator values used to initialize the value of an outgoing 
propagator \f$ q(\textbf{r}, s) \f$ at position \f$ \textbf{r} \f$ 
is a product of values of all incoming propagators for that vertex, 
evaluated at the same position \f$ \textbf{r} \f$, while excluding 
the incoming propagator that is associated with the same block as the 
outgoing propagator of interest from the product. In the simple case 
of a linear polymer, this requires that initial condition at 
\f$ s = 0 \f$ for each outgoing propagator at each junction is simply 
equal to the value of the incoming propagator associated with the 
other block that is attached to that junction.

\subsection user_theory_products_sub Propagators Products 

The probability of finding a specific monomer that is located a contour 
distance \f$ s \f$ from one of the two vertices that are connected by a 
block located at a specified position \f$ \textbf{r} \f$ is proportional 
to the product 
\f[
     q(\textbf{r},s) q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r},L-s) \quad,
\f]
in which we have used \f$ q \f$ and \f$ q^{\dagger} \f$ to denote the 
two propagators associated with that block, and arbitrarily taken 
\f$ s \f$ to be the contour distance measured from the vertex at which 
\f$ q(\textbf{r},s) \f$ originates, while \f$ L \f$ denotes the length 
of the block. 

It is straightforward to show that the value of the product 
\f$ q q^{\dagger}\f$ at \f$ s=0 \f$, corresponding to the vertex at 
which \f$ q \f$ originates, is equal to the product of the final values 
of all the incoming propagators for this vertex.
To show this, note that \f$ q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r},s=0) \f$ is the final 
value for the incoming propagator associated with the block of interest, 
while the initial condition for \f$ q \f$ requires that its value at 
\f$ s=0 \f$ be equal to the product of the final values of incoming 
propagators associated with all other blocks (if any) that are attached 
to that vertex.  If \f$ q \f$ originates at a chain end, then 
\f$q(\textbf{r}, s) = 1\f$, and so this product simply yields the value 
of the one incoming propagagator \f$ q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r}, s) \f$ at 
that chain end. By applying similar reasoning to the vertex at which 
\f$ q^{\dagger} \f$ originates and \f$q\f$ terminates, we may show that 
the value of the product \f$ q q^{\dagger} \f$ at \f$s=L\f$ must equal 
the product of final values of all of the incoming propagators for this 
vertex. 

Consider the integral the behavior of the spatial integral
\f[
   I(s) \equiv 
   \int d\textbf{r} \; q (\textbf{r},s) q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r},L-s)
\f]
evaluated at a fixed contour coordinate \f$ s \f$ within some specified 
block, where the integral is taken over the entire spatial domain for 
the model of interest.  It is straightforward to show that the value of 
\f$ I(s)\f$ is actually independent of the the value of the the contour 
coordinate \f$ s \f$. To show this, note that
\f{eqnarray*} 
  \frac{dI(s)}{ds} & = & \frac{d}{ds} 
  \int d\textbf{r} \; 
  q (\textbf{r},s) q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r},L-s) \\
  & = & 
  \int d\textbf{r} \;  \left \{
  \frac{\partial q (\textbf{r},s)}{\partial s} 
  q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r},L-s)  
  - q (\textbf{r},s) 
  \frac{\partial q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r},L-s)}{\partial s}  
  \right \} \\
  & = & 
  \int d\textbf{r} \;  \left \{
  [ \hat{H} q (\textbf{r},s) ] q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r},L-s) 
  - q (\textbf{r},s) [\hat{H} q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r},L-s)]  
  \right \}
  \quad.
\f}
We may then use the fact that the operator \f$ \hat{H} \f$ (like the 
analogous quantum mechanical Hamiltonian operator for a particle 
in a potential) can be shown to be a self-adjoint or Hermitian 
differential operator to show that the two terms in the right-hand-side 
of the last line of the above equation must cancel, giving
\f[
    dI(s)/ds = 0 \quad.
\f]
The fact that the value of this integral is independent of \f$ s \f$
within each block also implies that it must have the same value in
the limits \f$ s=0 \f$ and \f$ s=L \f$, corresponding to its values at 
the two attached vertices. Combining this with our previous observations, 
we find that the spatial integral of the product of incoming propagators 
must have the same value at any two vertices that are directly attached
by a block.  Because all vertices in a polymer are connected by some
sequence of blocks, this implies that the value of this spatial 
integral must be the same for every vertex in any acyclic branched 
polymer.

\subsection user_theory_bigQ_sub Molecular Partition Function

Let \f$ Q_{i} \f$ denote a normalized single-chain partition function 
for a polymer molecule of species \f$ i \f$ in a specified set of 
effective monomer potential fields. We define the value of this quantity 
to be given by the spatial average (i.e., the integral over the entire 
spatial domain of the problem divided by the volume of this domain) of 
the product of the values of the incoming propagators evaluated at a 
vertex of the polymer. The above discussion implies that we should get
the same value for this quantity by evaluating it using any vertex in
a polymer. A particularly compact expression for this quantity may be 
obtained by evaluating it at any chain end, for which we obtain
\f[
   Q_{i} = \frac{1}{V} \int \! d\textbf{r} \; q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r},L)
\f]
where \f$q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r}, L)\f$ denotes the final value of 
the single incoming propagator at that chain end, where \f$ L \f$ 
is the length of the attached block. Here, the integral is taken 
over the entire spatial domain for the problem of interest, while 
\f$ V \f$ is the generalized volume of that domain. In the the case 
of a periodic structure, the required spatial average may be evaluated 
by evaluating the integral over one crystallographic unit cell and 
then dividing by the generalized volume of that unit cell  (i.e., the 
volume per unit cell for a 3D crystal, area per 2D unit cell for a 2D 
structure such as a hexagonal cylinder phase, or the length per unit 
cell in a 1D lamellar phase).

\subsection user_theory_phi_sub Block Volume Fractions

Let \f$ \phi_{ai}(\textbf{r})\f$ denote the local volume fraction of 
monomers belonging to block \f$ a \f$ of polymer species \f$ i \f$.
This quantity is given by a product
\f[
   \phi_{a i}(\textbf{r}) =  
   \frac{\overline{\phi}_{i}}{L_{i}Q_{i}}
   \int\limits_{0}^{L_{ai}} \! ds \;
    q(\textbf{r},s) q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r},s)
\f]
in which \f$ \overline{\phi}_{i}\f$ is the average overall volume 
fraction of molecule species \f$ i \f$ within the mixture, \f$ L_{ai} \f$ 
is the contour length of the block of interest, and \f$ L_{i} \f$ is the 
sum of the contour lengths of all of the blocks of species \f$ i \f$.

\section user_theory_solvent_sec Solvent Species

Each solvent species \f$ i\f$ is associated with a specific 
monomer type \f$ \alpha\f$ and a ``size" \f$ N_i\f$ . A "monomer" 
type that is assigned to a solvent species may or may not also be 
contained within one or more of the polymeric species. 

In the single molecule problem for solvent species, the free energy 
penalty for a solvent molecule of monomer type \f$ \alpha\f$ to be 
located at position \f$ \textbf{r} \f$ is given by 
\f$ k_{B}T N_{i} w_{\alpha}(\textbf{r})\f$ .
This yields a solvent volume fraction field
\f$ \phi_{i}(\textbf{r}) \propto \exp(-N_{i}w_{\alpha}(\textbf{r})) \f$ . 

The normalized overall partition for such a point-like species is given by 
an integral 
\f[
   Q_{i} = \frac{1}{V}
   \int \! d\textbf{r} \; \exp(-N_{i}w_{\alpha}(\textbf{r}))
\f]
The contribution of solvent species \f$ i\f$ of type \f$ \alpha\f$ to 
the local volume fraction of \f$ \alpha \f$ is given by a ratio
\f[

   \phi_{\alpha}^{(i)}(\textbf{r}) = 
   \frac{\overline{\phi}_{i}}{Q_{i}} 
   \exp(-N_{i}w_{\alpha}(\textbf{r}))

\f]
in which \f$ \overline{\phi}_{i} \f$ is the overall volume fraction of
species \f$ i \f$ within the mixture. 

The total volume fraction \f$ \phi_{\alpha}(\textbf{r}) \f$ for each
monomer type \f$ \alpha\f$ is simply the sum of volume fractions for
all polymer blocks and all solvent species that contain monomers of
of type \f$ \alpha\f$ .

\section user_theory_thermo_sec Thermodynamic Properties

The Helmholtz free energy per monomer reference volume, as given in 
the output file, is given by a sum
\f{eqnarray*}
    \frac{F v}{Vk_{B}T} 
    & = & \sum_{i=1}^{P+S} \frac{\overline{\phi}_{i}}{N_{i}} 
    \left [ \ln ( \overline{\phi}_{i} / Q_{i}) - 1 \right ] \\
    & & - \frac{1}{V}
          \sum_{\alpha=1}^{C} 
          \int \! d\textbf{r} \; 
          w_{\alpha}(\textbf{r})
          \phi_{\alpha}(\textbf{r}) \\
    & & +  \frac{1}{2V} 
          \sum_{\alpha, \beta =1}^{C}  \chi_{\alpha\beta}
          \int \! d\textbf{r} \; 
          \phi_{\alpha}(\textbf{r})
          \phi_{\beta}(\textbf{r})

\f}
Note that the sum over species in the first line is a sum over all 
species, including polymeric and solvent species, with different ways 
of defining \f$ Q_{i} \f$ for different types of molecule.

The corresponding chemical potential \f$ \mu_{i}\f$ for species \f$ i\f$ 
is given by
\f[

    \frac{\mu_{i}}{k_{B}T} = \ln(\overline{\phi}_{i}/Q_{i})

\f]
The value given in the output files is \f$ \mu_{i}/k_{B}T \f$ .

The macroscopic physical pressure \f$ P\f$ is computed from the identity
\f[
    P = - \frac{F}{V} 
        + \sum_{i=1}\frac{\mu_{i}\overline{\phi}_{i}}{N_{i}v} 
\f]
in which \f$ F / V \f$ is the Helmholtz free energy density and
\f$ \overline{\phi}_{i}/(N_{i}v) \f$ is the average number of molecules 
of species \f$ i \f$ per unit volume. The value given in the output file 
is the dimensionless value \f$ Pv/k_{B}T \f$ .

\section user_theory_ensemble_sec Open and Closed Ensembles

PSCF can be carry out calculations using either canonical ensemble or 
grand-canonical ensemble. 

In canonical ensemble a value of the overall volume fraction 
\f$ \overline{\phi}_{i} \f$ must be given for each species in 
the input parameter file, and values of chemical potential are 
computed from the solution.

In grand canonical ensemble, a value of the normalized chemical 
potential \f$ \mu_{i}/k_{B}T \f$ must be given for each species in
the input parameter file, and average volume fractions for each
species are computed.

In grand-canonical ensemble, values for the Lagrange multplier
field \f$ \xi(\textbf{r}) \f$ and the macroscopic pressure \f$ P\f$ 
are uniquely determined by the values for the chemical potentials. 

In canonical ensemble, the value of the Lagrange multplier field 
\f$ \xi(\textbf{r}) \f$ is defined only to within a arbitrary
spatially homogeneous constant. As a result, the chemical potentials
and the macroscopic pressure \f$ P \f$ are also undefined in this
ensemble, unless an additional constraint is imposed. PSCF resolves 
this ambiguity by requiring, as a matter of convention, that the 
spatial average of \f$ \xi(\textbf{r}) \f$ vanish. In this ensemble,
PSCF also outputs values for the pressure, chemical potentials, and 
\f$ w \f$ fields that are all consistent with this convention
for the average value of \f$ \xi \f$ . Values for the Hemholtz free
energy density of an incompressible liquid can, however, be shown 
to be independent of changes in the value of \f$ \xi \f$ by a 
homogeneous constant, and are thus independent of this choice of
convention.
