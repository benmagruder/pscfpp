An external visualization package named 
<a href="https://github.com/kdorfmanUMN/polymer_visual">Polymer Visual</a>
is available. This package is designed to allow users of PSCF to generate 
figures that characterize the kinds of periodic structures predicted by 
the pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs. Polymer Visual can read files containing 
the monomer concentration fields written in the 
\ref user_field_rgrid_page "r-grid" field file format used by pscf_pc 
and pscf_pg, and can generate several different types of color plots, 
including plots that show volume fractions along one- and two-dimensional 
cuts through a structure, and three-dimensional perspective plots.

Polymer Visual is written as a package of MATLAB functions. It may be 
cloned or downloaded as a zip file from the github repository 
<a href="https://github.com/kdorfmanUMN/polymer_visual"> github.com/kdorfmanUMN/polymer_visual </a>.
The main web page of that repository provides a complete user manual, 
which includes some examples of the different types of plots that can be 
generated.
