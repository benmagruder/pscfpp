<BR>

The pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs for periodic systems use nearly identical
parameter file formats, and so are discussed together here.

\section user_param_pc_example_sec Example
An example of a parameter file for the program pscf_pc3D is shown below. 

\code
System{
  Mixture{
    nMonomer  2
    monomers[
              A   1.0  
              B   1.0 
    ]
    nPolymer  1
    Polymer{
      type    linear
      nBlock  2
      blocks[
              0  0.25
              1  0.75
      ]
      phi     1.0
    }
    ds   0.01
  }
  Interaction{
    chi(
          1   0   20.0
    )
  }
  Domain{

    mesh             32  32  32
    groupName        I_m_-3_m
  }
  Iterator{
    maxItr       100

  }
}
\endcode

\section user_param_pc_system_sec File Format

The main System block of a parameter file for any of the pscf_pc and 
pscf_pg programs for has the same overall structure as that used by 
pscf_fd program, and is described by the same format skeleton:
\code
System{
  Mixture{ ...  }
  Interaction{ ...  }
  Domain{ ...  }
  Iterator#{ ... }
  Sweep#*{ ... }
}
\endcode
As for pscf_fd, the Sweep block is optional, and Iterator and Sweep blocks 
(if present) are both selectable blocks.  The purposes of these top-level 
blocks have all been discussed previously in the discussion of pscf_fd, and 
will not be repeated here.  Formats of the Mixture and Interaction blocks 
are the same for all PSCF programs, and so have also been discussed 
previously. Below, we discuss the contents of the Domain, Iterator, and 
Sweep blocks.

\section user_param_pc_domain_sec Domain Block

The Domain block contains information required to describe both unit 
cell of the periodic structure, the regular mesh that is used to 
discretize fields within each unit cell, and the space group of the 
desired solution.
The parameter file format is discussed below, as well as in separate
page \subpage pspc_Domain_page "here". 

An example of the format of this block is shown below:
\code
  Domain{
    unitCell    cubic   1.9254998725
    mesh        32  32  32
    groupName   I_m_-3_m
  }
\endcode
The unitCell, mesh and groupName parameter lines are discussed separately 
below.

<b> unitCell </b>

The line that begins with the label unitCell contains information 
required to specify an initial value of the crystal unit cell.  The data 
on this line contains a string that specifies the desired crystal system 
followed by one or more unit cell parameters. The format is thus
\code
   unitCell   crystalSystem  param[0] ..... param[m]
\endcode
where m denotes the number of independent parameters required to
describe a unit cell of the specified crystal system. The allowed 
values of the crystalSystem string for a 3D structure currently 
include "cubic", "tetragonal" and "orthorhombic".  The cubic
crystal system used in the parameter file only requires one unit
cell parameter, which is the length of each axis of a simple 
cubic unit cell. 

Note: The list of unit cell parameters that is input in the parameter 
file is actually only used within an algorithm that constructs a 
set of symmetry adapted Fourier basis functions, and then discarded.
Values of initial guesses for initial unit cell dimensions of a system 
to which we want to apply self-consistent field theory are obtained 
later by reading a file that contains an initial guess for the monomer 
chemical potential fields (w-fields), which also contains corresponding 
unit cell dimensions.

<b> mesh  </b>

The value is the variable "mesh" is a vector of integers that specifies 
the number of grid points along each direction of the uniform spatial 
mesh used to discretize fields within each unit cell.  The format is
\code
   mesh   N[0] .... N[D-1]
\endcode
where D is the dimension of space (i.e., the number of periodic
directions), and N[i] is the number of grid points along axis
number i, for i = 0,...,D-1.

<b> groupName </b>:

The value of the string parameter "spaceGroup" must be an standard
identifier for the crystallographic space group of the desired 
structure. 
Each of the allowed values of the groupName string corresponds to a 
modified version of the name of the space group, as listed in the 
international tables of crystallography. In the above example, the 
groupName string I_m_-3_m is a modified form of the name 
\f$Im\overline{3}m\f$ for the space group for a BCC lattice.  
Identifiers for crystallographic space groups are discussed and
listed \ref user_groups_page "here". 

\section user_param_pc_Iterator_section Iterators

The default Iterator for the pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs uses an 
Anderson-Mixing (AM) iterator algorithm. This can be invoked using 
either the generic label "Iterator" or the specific label "AmIterator".  
The only other iterator currently available is an Anderson-Mixing 
iterator designed specifically for problems in which a polymer melt or 
mixture is confined to a thin film (see \ref user_thin_films_page ). 

Descriptions of the parameter file formats for the available iterators
can be found by following the links in the table below:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td> Label </td>
    <td> Description  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> \subpage pspc_AmIterator_page "AmIterator" </td>
    <td> Anderson Mixing iterator for periodic structures.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> \subpage pspc_AmIteratorFilm_page "AmIteratorFilm" </td>
    <td> Thin Film Anderson Mixing iterator. Uses the Anderson Mixing 
         algorithm to solve the SCFT equations for a system that is
         confined to a thin film. </td>
  </tr>
</table>

\section user_param_pc_sweep_sec Sweep

The default sweep for the pscf_pc programs is a linear sweep algorithm 
that can be invoked using a block that starts either with the generic 
label Sweep or the specific label LinearSweep. The required parameter 
file format has been described \ref user_param_sweep_linear_sec "here".
