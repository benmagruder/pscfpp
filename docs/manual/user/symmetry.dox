The space group of a crystal is a set of symmetry operations under which
the structure is invariant. Space group symmetry operatioms generally
involve combination of point group operations and translations by
fractions of a unit cell. Point group operations involve transformations
such as inversion through the origin, reflection through a plane, or
rotation around a symmetry axis by some fraction of a full rotation.

<b> Definition (Crystal Symmetry Operation) </b>:
Every crystal symmetry operation \f$ A \f$ is a function that maps
every position \f$ {\bf r} \f$ within a crystal onto a new position
\f$ A({\bf r}) \f$ of the form
\f[
   A({\bf r}) =  R {\bf r} + {\bf t}
\f]
in which \f$ R \f$ is an invertible linear operator that acts on the
vector \f$ {\bf r} \f$ to its right by applying a point group operation
(e.g., a reflection, rotation, or inversion), and in which \f$ {\bf t}\f$
is a translation vector. The translation vector associated with a space
group symmetry operation can be zero, giving a pure point group
operation, or can be a sum of translations by rational fractions of a
unit cell along Bravais lattice basis vectors.

Notation: Here and hereafter, we use bold faced symbols to denote vectors
such as \f$ {\bf r} \f$.  We define an inner-product space for vectors by
defining the dot product \f$ {\bf a}\cdot{\bf b} \f$ of two vectors to be
given by the usual Euclidean norm computed using a Cartesian vector
components.  The norm of a vector, denoted by \f$ |{\bf a}| \f$, is
then given by the Cartesian norm
\f[
     |{\bf a}| = \sqrt{{\bf a}\cdot{\bf a}}
\f]
The adjoint of any linear operator \f$ R \f$ in this vector space is
denoted by \f$ R^{T} \f$, and is defined by the requirement that
\anchor user_symmetry_adjoint_def_eqn
\f[
  (R^{T}{\bf a}) \cdot {\bf b} = {\bf a} \cdot (R {\bf b})
\f]
for any two D-dimensional vectors \f$ {\bf a} \f$ and \f$ {\bf b} \f$.

The point group operator \f$ R \f$ associated with a crystal symmetry
operation is is always an orthogonal operator (i.e., a unitary operator
in a real vector space) that does not change the norm of any vector on
which it operates. That is, for any point group operator \f$ R \f$,
\f[
   |R{\bf v}| = |{\bf v}|
\f]
for any vector \f$ {\bf v} \f$.

\anchor user_symmetry_multiplication_def
<b> Definition (Multiplication) </b>:
Multiplication of symmetry operations is defined such that the product
\f$ AB \f$ of two symmetry operations \f$ A \f$ and \f$ B \f$ is the
operation whose effect on a vector is given by applying \f$ B \f$
followed by \f$ A \f$.  That is, if \f$ A \f$, \f$ B \f$, and \f$ C \f$
are crystal symmetry operations, such that
\f[
   C = AB
\f]
then
\f[
     C({\bf r}) \equiv A(B({\bf r})) \quad.
\f]
Multiplication of symmetry operations is not commutative: Generally,
\f$ AB \neq BA \f$.

\anchor user_symmetry_multiplication_thrm
<b> Theorem (Multiplication Rule) </b>:
If \f$ A \f$, \f$ B \f$ are two symmetry operations
\f[
   A = (R_{A}, {\bf t}_{A}) \quad
   B = (R_{B}, {\bf t}_{B}) \quad
\f]
and \f$ C = AB \f$ is their product, then
\f[
   C = AB = (R_{C}, {\bf t}_{C}) \quad,
\f]
with
\f[
   R_{C} = R_{A}R_{B} \quad
   {\bf t}_{C} = {\bf t}_{A} + R_{A}{\bf t}_{B} \quad.
\f]

<em> Proof </em>: Observe that \f$ C({\bf r}) = A(B({\bf r})) \f$ for
any vector \f$ {\bf r} \f$, and that
\f[
   A(B({\bf r}))
   = A(R_{B}{\bf r} + {\bf t}_{B})
   = R_{A} R_{B} {\bf r} + R_{A} {\bf t}_{B} + {\bf t}_{A} \quad.
\f]

\anchor user_symmetry_identity_def
<b> Identity Operation </b>:
The identity operation, denoted by \f$ E \f$, is the trivial symmetry
operation that maps every position onto itself, so that
\f[
   E({\bf r}) = {\bf r}  \quad.
\f]
This is represented by a pair
\f[
   E = (I, 0) \quad,
\f]
in which we use \f$ I \f$ to denote the identity point group operation,
for which the matrix representation in any basis is an identity matrix.
Mutlplication of any other symmetry operation \f$ A \f$ by the identity
leaves \f$ A \f$ unchanged, such that \f$ EA = AE = A \f$.

\anchor user_symmetry_identity_thrm
<b> Defininition (Inverse) </b>:
Every crystal symmetry operation \f$ A \f$ has an inverse, denoted by
\f$ A^{-1} \f$, which is defined such that
\f[
   A^{-1}A = A A^{-1} = E \quad.
\f]
The identity element is equal its own inverse, since \f$ EE = E \f$.

<b> Theorem (Inversion Rule)</b> : If \f$A\f$ is a crystal symmetry
operation
\f[
   A = (R, {\bf t})
\f]
with point group operation \f$R\f$ and translation vector \f${\bf t}\f$,
then
\f[
   A^{-1} = (R^{-1}, -R^{-1}{\bf t}) \quad.
\f]

<em> Proof </em>:
Use the \ref user_symmetry_multiplication_thrm "multiplication rule"
to confirm that \f$ A^{-1}A = A A^{-1} = (I, 0) = E \f$.

\section user_symmetry_group_sec Space Groups

<b> Definition (Space Group) </b>
A space group \f$ S \f$ is a set of crystal symmetry operations
for which multiplication is defined as discussed
\ref user_symmetry_multiplication_def "above", and for which:

   - Inclusion of identity: \f$ S \f$ includes the identity \f$ E \f$

   - Closure under inversion:
     If \f$ S \f$ contains an element \f$ A \f$, \f$ S \f$ also
     contains \f$ A^{-1} \f$.

   - Closure under multiplication:
     If \f$ S \f$ contains \f$ A \f$ and \f$ B \f$, it also contains
     the product \f$ A B \f$.

It is known that there are only 230 possible distinct 3D space groups,
17 possible distinct 2D plane groups, and 2 possible symmetry groups in
1D, as discussed \ref user_groups_page "here".  The data/groups directory
contains files that each list all of the symmetry elements for one of
these groups.

\section user_symmetry_components_sec Vector Bases

Different vector bases are used in PSCF for vectors that represent
positions or translations and for vectors that represent reciprocal
lattice wavevectors.

\subsection user_symmetry_components_bravais_sub Bravais Basis (Positions and Translations)

It is convenient for to define components of position vectors such as a
position \f$ {\bf r} \f$ or a translation \f$ {\bf t} \f$ using a basis
of Bravais lattice basis vector. We refer to this as a Bravais basis.
Any position vector \f$ {\bf r} \f$ may be expressed in a Bravais basis
as a sum
\f[
  {\bf r} = \sum_{i=0}^{D-1} r_{i}{\bf a}_{i}
\f]
in which \f$ {\bf a}_{0},\ldots, {\bf a}_{D-1} \f$ are Bravais lattice
basis vectors, while \f$ r_{0}, \ldots, r_{D-1} \f$ are components of
\f$ {\bf r} \f$ in this basis, also known as reduced coordinates.
Similarly, the translational vector \f$ {\bf t} \f$ associated with a
space group symmetry may be expressed as a sum
\f[
  {\bf t} = t_{0}{\bf a}_{0} + \cdots t_{D-1}{\bf a}_{D-1}
\f]
in which the components \f$ t_{0}, \ldots, t_{D-1} \f$ are all rational
numbers (i.e., fractions) with small denominators, such as
\f$ \pm 1/2 \f$, \f$ 1/4 \f$, \f$ 2/3 \f$, etc.

Notation: Here and hereafer, we use a notation in which the components of
a vector \f$ {\bf a} \f$ in a specified basis are denoted by subscripted
variables \f$ a_{0}, \ldots, a_{D-1} \f$, using bold- and non-bold faced
versions of the same symbol for a vector and its components.

A representation of a point group operator \f$ R \f$ as a matrix may
be defined by using a Bravais basis to define the components of the
vector \f$ R{\bf r} \f$ for any vector \f$ {\bf r} \f$. This gives a
representation of \f$ R{\bf r} \f$ as a sum
\f[
   R {\bf r} =
   \sum_{i=0}^{D-1} \sum_{j=0}^{D-1}
   {\bf a}_{i} R_{ij} r_{j}
\f]
where \f$ (r_{0}, \ldots, r_{D-1}) \f$ are components of \f$ {\bf r} \f$
and \f$ R_{ij} \f$ denotes a matrix element of \f$ R \f$ in a Bravais
basis.  The matrix representation of a point group operation in a Bravais
basis must have matrix elements that are all integers (usually 0, 1, or
-1), in order to guarantee that this operation maps all Bravais lattice
vectors onto other Bravais lattice vectors.

PSCF stores the representation of each symmetry operation \f$ A \f$
internally as a pair
\f[
    A = ( R, {\bf t})
\f]
in which \f$ R \f$ is represented as a \f$ D \times D \f$ matrix with
integer matrix elements and \f$ {\bf t} \f$ represented as a vector
with \f$ D \f$ components that is represented as a rational number
(i.e., ratio of two integers). Each space group symmetry is represented
as an instance of a class Pscf::SpaceSymmetry<D>. Each element of
the translation vector \f$ {\bf t} \f$ is represented by an instance
of class Util::Rational.

\subsection user_symmetry_components_reciprocal_sub Reciprocal Basis (Wavevectors)

It is convenient to express reciprocal lattice wavevectors in a basis of
reciprocal lattice basis vectors, which we refer to as a reciprocal basis.
In this representation, each reciprocal lattice wavevector \f$ G \f$ is
expressed as a linear combination
\f[
  {\bf G} = \sum_{i=0}^{D-1} G_{i}{\bf b}_{i}
\f]
in which \f$ {\bf b}_{0}, \ldots, {\bf b}_{D-1} \f$ are reciprocal
lattice basis vectors, defined such that
\f[
  {\bf a}_{i}\cdot{\bf b}_{j} = 2\pi \delta_{ij} \quad,
\f]
for all \f$ i, j = 0, \ldots, D-1\f$, and in  which
\f$ G_{0}, \ldots, G_{D-1} \f$ are integer components (Miller indices).

When a reciprocal basis is used for a wavevectors \f$ {\bf G} \f$ and
a Bravais basis is used for a position \f$ {\bf r} \f$, then the dot
product \f$ {\bf G}\cdot{\bf r} \f$ may be expressed as a sum
\f[
   {\bf G} \cdot {\bf r}
   = 2\pi \sum_{i=0}^{D-1} G_{i} r_{i} \quad,
\f]
where \f$ G_{0}, \ldots, G_{D-1} \f$ are the integer components of
\f$ {\bf G} \f$ in a reciprocal basis and \f$ r_{0}, \ldots, r_{D-1} \f$
are reduced coordinates of \f$ {\bf r} \f$.

\subsection user_symmetry_adjoint_matrix_sub Adjoint Operators in Wavevector Space

Suppose that \f$ {\bf G} \f$ is a reciprocal lattice vector, \f$ R \f$
is a linear operator that can be applied to a position vector, and
\f[
  {\bf G}' = R^{T}{\bf G}
\f]
is a wavevector obtained by applying the adjoint operator \f$ R^{T} \f$
to \f$ {\bf G} \f$. To define \f$ R^{T}{\bf G} \f$, we must consider the
dot product of \f$ {\bf G} \f$ with \f$ R {\bf r} \f$ for arbitrary
\f$ {\bf G} \f$ and \f$ {\bf r} \f$ .  By using a basis of reciprocal
lattice basis vectors for \f$ {\bf G} \f$ and a basis of Bravais lattice
basis vectors for \f$ R{\bf r} \f$, we may show
\f[
   {\bf G} \cdot R {\bf r} = 2\pi
   \sum_{i=0}^{D-1} \sum_{j=0}^{D-1} G_{i}R_{ij}r_{j}
\f]
for any \f$ {\bf G} \f$ and \f$ {\bf r} \f$, where
\f$ (G_{0}, \ldots, G_{D-1}) \f$ are compoments of \f$ {\bf G} \f$
in a reciprocal lattice basis and
\f$ (r_{0}, \ldots, r_{D-1}) \f$  are components of \f$ {\bf r} \f$
in a Bravais lattice basis.  Comparing this to the definition of an 
adjoint, we conclude that \f$ {\bf G}' \f$ may be expanded as a sum
\f[
  {\bf G}' = \sum_{j=0}^{D-1} G_{j}' {\bf b}_{j}
\f]
with components
\f[
  G_{j}'
  = \sum_{i=0}^{D-1} G_{i} R_{ij} = \sum_{i=0}^{D-1} R_{ji}^{T} G_{i}
  \quad.
\f]
The matrix representation of the operator \f$ R^{T} \f$ in a reciprocal
basis (which we use for wavevectors), is thus given by the transpose of 
the matrix representation of \f$ R \f$ in a Bravais basis.
