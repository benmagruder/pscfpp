To compile PSCF in a unix environment, before compiling any code, 
the user should modify the following unix environment variables:

  - Add the pscfpp/bin directory to the unix PATH shell 
    environment variable (the shell command search path)

  - Add the pscfpp/lib/python directory to the PYTHONPATH 
    environment variable (the python module search path)

Rationale: 

  - By default, executables files created by the PSCF build system
    are installed in the pscfpp/bin directory.  The directory that
    contains these files must be added to the user's PATH variable 
    in order to allow the unix shell to find these executable files 
    when they are invoked by name from the command line.

  - The pscfpp/lib/python directory contains a python script that is 
    used by the build system during compilation to generate information 
    about dependencies among C++ files. This directory must be added to 
    the PYTHONPATH variable in order to allow the python interpreter to
    find this script for use during compilation.

The required changes to a users shell environment should be made in
a manner that guarantees that these changes are automatically in place
whenever that user is logged on. To accomplish this, commands that apply
the required modifications to PATH and PYTHON path should be added to 
a configuration file in the users home directory that is read and 
executed whenever the user launches a login shell (e.g., to the .profile
or .bash_profile file on systems that use a bash shell or the .zprofile 
file on systems that use a zsh unix shell, as discussed in more detail
below). An example of the required commands is shown below:
\code
PSCFPP_DIR=${HOME}/pscfpp
export PATH=${PATH}:/${PSCFPP_DIR}/bin
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/${PSCFPP_DIR}/lib/python
\endcode
The value of the shell variable PSCFPP_DIR that appears in this example 
should be set to the absolute path to the pscfpp root directory (i.e., 
the root of the directory tree created by cloning the pscfpp git 
repository).  In the above example, it is assumed that this is a 
subdirectory named pscfpp within the users home directory, where ${HOME} 
is an environment variable that expands to the path to the users home 
directory.

The name of the file to which these commands should be added depends
on which unix shell is being used. Different unix shells are used by
default in different linux and Mac OS X operatings systems. 

The bash shell is the default shell on most linux systems.
The bash shell reads files named .profile and/or .bash_profile in the 
users home directory, if either exists, when the user opens a login 
shell by logging in to the system. Users who are using a bash shell
should put these commands in one of these files. 

Recent versions of the Mac OS operating system instead use zsh (also
known as the Z shell) by default within the Mac Terminal app. We 
recommend that mac users who are using zsh from within the Terminal
app place these commands in a file named .zprofile. The .zprofile
file is executed by Terminal app opens every time you open a new 
terminal window.
