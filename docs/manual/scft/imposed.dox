\section scft_imposed_overview_sec Overview

The SCFT iterators used by pscf_pc and pscf_pg allow users to define two 
different types of externally imposed fields to describe situations in 
which a polymeric material interacts with an inhomogeneous environment.
A "mask" field is used to describe geometric confinement to a specified
region in a manner that does not distinguish among different monomer
types. "External" fields instead specify preferential potential energy
biases that can induce preferential accumulation of particular monomer 
types in specific locations. The two features can be used together to 
allow SCFT calculations to describe situations in which a material is 
confined to a region, such a thin film and in which the confining 
surfaces exhibit preferential wetting, using external fields that are 
nonzero only in narrow regions near the confining surfaces to induce 
wetting.  As described below, a mask field is implemented as a modification 
of the incompressibility constraint, whereas the external fields are 
implemented via addition of an external field term to the self-consistent 
field equation for each monomer type. The resulting framework is designed 
to be quite general and extensible by users. The current version of PSCF 
is distributed with a set tools that use this framework to simulate 
confinement of polymer to a thin film with chemically homogeneous but 
selective top and bottom surfaces.

We refer to a mask and a set of external fields collectively as "imposed 
fields" for a given SCFT calculation. These imposed fields can be defined
by either of two methods. 

  - Mask and external fields can be defined in field files that are
    created separately by the user, which can be read into PSCF using 
    any of several commands that are designed for this purpose, as 
    described below and in the \ref scft_command_pc_page "commands" 
    page. 

  - Mask and external fields may be generated within the PSCF software
    using an \ref scft_imposed_generator_sec "ImposedFieldsGenerator" 
    object that reads a few parameters specific to a particular type of 
    calculation from the parameter file (e.g., the thickness of a film 
    and parameters that describe the strength of preferential wetting) 
    and generates an appropriate set of imposed fields. 

PSCF is currently distributed with an ImposedFieldGenerator that can
generate imposed fields for simulating thin films with preferential
wetting.  Thin films are simulated using a "supercell" that contains 
alternating regions of polymer and vaccum, as defined by a periodic 
"mask" field.  This thin film field generator is described in detail 
on the \subpage scft_thin_films_page "Thin Films" page. 

The declared space-group symmetry of an SCFT calculation with imposed 
fields must be chosen so as to guarantee that the mask and external 
fields are invariant under all elements of the declared space group. 
The space group that best describes a given system is that which contains 
every symmetry operation shared by the mask, the external fields, and 
the polymer morphology itself; this is typically a lower-symmetry space 
group than that of the bulk polymer morphology that would be formed in 
the absence of any imposed fields. The choice of an appropriate 
space-group for a thin film morphology that is defined in a periodic 
super-cell is discussed in the \ref scft_thin_films_page "Thin Films" 
page. 

\section scft_imposed_mask_sec Mask field

The iterators used in pscf_pc allows users to define a "mask" field that 
imposes geometric confinement within the unit cell by modifying the 
incompressibility constraint. A mask field is a dimensionless function of 
position, denoted here by \f$ m({\bf r}) \f$, that has a value very close 
to 1 throughout a region to which the polymer material is confined and a 
value very close to 0 throughout a region from which the material is being 
excluded. The incompressibility constraint for a system that is subjected 
to a mask is modified so as to require that
\f[
   v \sum_{\alpha=1} c_\alpha({\bf r}) = m({\bf r})
\f]
at every point in the system, where \f$ m({\bf r}) \f$ is the mask field,
\f$ c_{\alpha}({\bf r}) \f$ is the number concentration of monomers of type
\f$ \alpha \f$ at point \f$ {\bf r} \f$, \f$ v \f$ is the monomer reference
volume, and the summation is over all distinct monomer types. Introduction
of a mask provides a simple way to impose geometric confinement within a
program that is designed for periodic systems. The mask can have any 
functional form as long as it satisfies the periodic boundary condition and
the space-group symmetry of the system.

A user-defined mask field may be read in from a file using the 
READ_MASK_BASIS to read a file in which the mask specified using the
symmetry-adapted basis file format or using the READ_MASK_RGRID command
to read in a mask that is defined using the r-grid format as a set 
values on nodes of the relevant grid. The READ_MASK_BASIS command must
be used to initialize a mask for a calculation in which the iterator 
an internal representation of the fields in a symmetry-adapted basis 
to search for a solution with a specified space-group symmetry. The 
READ_MASK_RGRID can only be used for calculations that use an iterator
that does not impose a space-group symmetry.

\section scft_imposed_external_sec External fields

The iterators in pscf_pc also allows users to define an external potential
field associated with each type of monomer in the system. In what follows,
let \f$ h_{\alpha}({\bf r}) \f$ denote the external field imposed on 
monomers of type \f$ \alpha \f$.  When nonzero external fields have been 
set, the self-consistent field equation for monomers of type \f$ alpha \f$
become an equation of the form
\f[
   w_{\alpha}({\bf r})
   = \sum_{\beta} \chi_{\alpha\beta} \phi_{\beta}({\bf r})
   + \xi({\bf r}) + h_{\alpha}({\bf r}) \quad,
\f]
in which \f$ \xi ({\bf r}) \f$ is the Lagrange multiplier local pressure 
field that imposes incompressibility, and \f$ \chi_{\alpha\beta} \f$ is 
the binary Flory-Huggins interaction parameter for  monomers of types 
\f$ \alpha \f$ and \f$ \beta \f$. These fields can also assume any form 
as long as they satisfy the periodic boundary condition and the declared
space-group symmetry of the calculation.

A list of external fields for all monomer types may be read from a file 
using READ_H_BASIS command to read in a file in which the fields are 
defined using a symmetry-basis or READ_H_RGRID to read in fields that 
are defined in r-grid format. The READ_H_BASIS command must be used to 
set external fields for any SCFT calculation that explicitly imposes a 
specified space-group symmetry.

\section scft_imposed_generator_sec ImposedFieldsGenerator objects

When studying a specific class of problems, such as polymer thin films, 
it is often most convenient to have appropriate mask and external fields 
generated algorithmically within the PSCF software, based on numerical 
values of a few parameters that are provided by the user within the 
parameter file.  This can be done by the use of an ImposedFieldGenerator 
object that is associated with the iterator.

An ImposedFieldsGenerator object is created by the inclusion of an 
optional block of the parameter file inside of the Iterator block, after 
all other Iterator parameters have been read. The first parameter inside 
of this ImposedFieldsGenerator block is "type". The software uses this 
"type" keyword to determine which imposed fields should be generated, what 
their functional form should be, and what parameters are necessary to 
define the imposed fields. Therefore, the implementation of the 
ImposedFieldsGenerator feature is entirely different depending on what 
keyword is provided as the value of the "type" parameter. All of the
parameters required for the specified "type" of calculation appear after 
the type parameter. 

An example is provided below for the "film" type, which is currently the
only allowed value for the type parameter:
\code
Iterator{
  epsilon      1e-6
  maxItr       100
  maxHist      50
  isFlexible   1
  ImposedFieldsGenerator{
    type         film 
    normalVecId  2
    interfaceThickness 0.2
    excludedThickness  0.4
    chiBottom[
                       0
                       10
    ]
    chiTop[
                       0
                       0
    ]
  }
}
\endcode
In this example, the film "type" parameter is followed by 5 input
parameters required to define a mask and external fields appropriate 
to thin film problem, which are named normalVecId, interfaceThickness, 
excludedThickness, chiBottom and chiTop.  The "film" type of 
ImposedFieldsGenerator is described in detail on 
the \ref scft_thin_films_page "Thin Films" page. 

One advantage of the use of an ImposedFieldsGenerator to programmatically
generate a mask and external fields is that this method allows these
imposed fields to be automatically recomputed during a calculation as 
needed. Regeneration of the fields can sometimes be required by changes 
in the unit cell parameters. The design of the ImposedFieldsGenerator
class also allows some specialized parameters that are defined within 
the associated parameter file block to be declared to be parameters
that can be varied during an SCFT parameter sweep, which generally
requires recomputation of the mask or external fields before each SCFT 
calculation within the sweep.  For example, for thin films, the chiBottom 
and chiTop parameters that control preferential wetting along the bottom 
and top surfaces to be varied during a linear parameter sweep, which
requires repeated recomputation of the associated external fields.

\section scft_imposed_freeenergy_sec Modified free energy calculation

In the presence of imposed fields, it is necessary to modify the free 
energy calculation to account for the fields. The free energy per monomer 
reference volume \f$ \tilde{f} \f$ is defined to be 
\f[
   \tilde{f} = \tilde{f}_{\rm id} + \tilde{f}_{\rm int} + \tilde{f}_{\rm ext}
\f]
where
\f{eqnarray*}
    \tilde{f}_{\rm id}
    & = & \sum_{i=0}^{P+S-1} \frac{\overline{\phi}_{i}}{\overline{m} L_{i}}
    \left[ \ln \left( \frac{\overline{\phi}_{i}}{\overline{m} Q_{i}}\right) 
     - 1 \right]
     - \frac{1}{\overline{m} V}
       \sum_{\alpha=0}^{C-1}
       \int \! d\textbf{r} \;
       w_{\alpha}(\textbf{r})
      \phi_{\alpha}(\textbf{r}) \\
    \tilde{f}_{\rm int}
    & = &  \frac{1}{2 \overline{m} V} \sum_{\alpha, \beta =0}^{C-1}
    \chi_{\alpha\beta} \int \! d\textbf{r} \;
    \phi_{\alpha}(\textbf{r}) \phi_{\beta}(\textbf{r}) \\
    \tilde{f}_{\rm ext} 
    & = &  \frac{1}{\overline{m}V} \sum_{\alpha=0}^{C-1}
    \int \! d\textbf{r} \;
       h_{\alpha}(\textbf{r})
      \phi_{\alpha}(\textbf{r})
\f}
where \f$ \overline{\phi_{i}} \f$ is the average volume fraction of species
\f$ i \f$ across the entire unit cell, and \f$ \phi_{\alpha}({\bf r}) \f$
is the local volume fraction of monomer \f$ \alpha \f$ at position **r**,
such that the sum of \f$ \phi_{\alpha}({\bf r}) \f$ over all species is
equal to \f$ m({\bf r}) \f$. \f$ \overline{m} \f$ is the average value of 
the mask function \f$ m({\bf r}) \f$ over the entire unit cell, representing 
the volume fraction of the unit cell that is occupied by polymer.

There are three changes in the above equations relative to those that
describe systems in the absence of imposed fields (see \ref
scft_propagator_thermo_sec "here"). 
- First, an additional term is added, \f$ \tilde{f}_{\rm ext} \f$, that
  contains the free energy arising from monomer species interacting with
  their associated external potential fields. This property is output along
  with the \ref scft_thermo_page "other thermodynamic properties" as "fExt"
  for any calculation that uses an external field. 
- Second, the overall volume fraction \f$ \overline{\phi_i} \f$ is replaced
  with \f$ \overline{\phi_i}/\overline{m} \f$. In a system containing a
  mask, the overall volume fractions \f$ \overline{\phi_i} \f$ will add to 
  \f$ \overline{m} \f$, rather than one. But the volume fraction that is
  relevant to thermodynamic properties like the entropy of mixing should
  be the fraction of each species in the melt, the sum of which should be 
  one. Therefore, we use \f$ \overline{\phi_i}/\overline{m} \f$.
- And third, we use \f$ \overline{m}V \f$ rather than \f$ V \f$ as the
  volume by which the integrals are normalized.  \f$ \overline{m} \f$ is
  the volume fraction of the unit cell that is occupied by polymer. 
  \f$ \overline{m}V \f$ is therefore the volume available to the polymers 
  in the system, and is the volume that is relevant to the polymer 
  thermodynamic properties. Note that \f$ \overline{m}V \f$ must also be 
  used to normalize the spatial integral used to calculate \f$ Q_i \f$ in 
  the presence of a mask.
