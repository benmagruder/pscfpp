===================
= Pscf++ History  =
===================

The following namespace names are used below to indicate which 
corresponding program or sets of programs are affected by specific changes.

   Pspc - CPU pseudo-spectral code for periodic structures
   Pspg - GPU pseudo-spectral code for periodic structures
   Fd1d - Finite element code for one-dimension (1D) problems
   all  - all programs (Fd1d, Pspc, and Pspg)


Progress towards Pscf++ v0.9
============================

User-visible changes
--------------------
- Changed default param file format for arrays and matrices (all).
  New format uses [] brackets or parentheses as delimiters for containers.
  The old format is still readable (i.e., backwards compatible).
- Implemented all crystal systems (triclinic, etc) (Pspc, Pspg)

Documentation
--------------
- Documentation of unit cell data format and space groups (Pspc, Pspg)
- Improved documentation of parameter file formats (all)


Pscf++ v0.8.1
==============

- Bugfix: Fixed an error in manual instructions for modifying PYTHONPATH 
  environment variable (github issue #64)


Pscf++ v0.8.0
==============

Released March 11, 2022

User-visible features
---------------------

* Sweep feature (continuation of a family of solutions) (Pspc)
* Point-particle solvent (Fd1d, Pspc, and Pspg)
* Open ensembles (grand canonical or mixed) in AmIterator (Pspc and Pspg)
* Allow grids with node counts that are not factors of 2 in Pspg

User-visible changes
--------------------
* Modified parameter file format for monomers, blocks and polymers (all)
* Added Domain{...} subblock in parameter file (Pspc and Pspg)
* Automated calculation of number of threads and blocks in GPU code (Pspg)
* Added make/compiler/homebrew-m1 config file for an m1 Mac using homebrew

Bug fixes
---------
* Fixed treatment of non-centrosymmetric groups (Pspc)
* Fixed calculation of monomer concentrations for mixtures (Pspc, Pspg)
* Fixed various bugs in GPU code (Pspg)

Developer-visible changes
-------------------------
* New github actions for testing of cpu code (after closure of travis site)
* Removed cancelled stars from array storage of basis coefficients (Pspc)
* Improved encapsulation of field data in Pspc::System (Pspc)
* Created unit tests for Pspg (GPU) code (Pspg)
* Reorganization / clean-up of Cuda kernels (Pspg)
* Class template for Anderson-mixing iterator algorithms (Pspc and Pspg)

Remaining known bugs
--------------------
* Incorrect treatment of non-centrosymmetric groups in Pspg (Pspg)
