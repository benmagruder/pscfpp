= Pscf++ History  =
===================

The following namespace names are used below to label changes that effect only 
particular programs or sets of programs, each of which is defined in the specifiec 
namespace:

   Pspc - CPU pseudo-spectral code for periodic structures
   Pspg - GPU pseudo-spectral code for periodic structures
   Fd1d - Finite element code for one-dimension (1D) problems


Pscf++ v0.8 
===========

Released planned for March 11, 2022

New user-visible features
-------------------------

* Sweep feature (continuation of a family of solutions) (Pspc)
* Point-particle solvent (Fd1d and Pspc)
* General open ensembles (grand canonical or mixed) in AmIterator (Pspc and Pspg)
* Allow use of grids with node counts that are not factors of 2 in Pspg

User-visible changes
--------------------
* Modified parameter file format for monomers, blocks and polymer structure 
* Automated calculation of number of threads and blocks in GPU code (Pspg)

Bugs fixed
----------
* Fixed bugs in treatment of non-centrosymmetric groups (Pspc and Pspg)
* Fixed bug in calculation of monomer concentrations for mixtures (Pspc and Pspg)
* Fixed various bugs in GPU code (Pspg)

Developer-visible changes
-------------------------
* Removed cancelled stars from array storage of basis coefficients (Pspc)
* Created unit tests for Pspg (GPU) code
* Unified code for Anderson-mixing iterator in Pspc and Pspg codes as template
* Improved encapsulation of field data in interface of Pspc::System
* Significant reorganization of Cuda kernels (Pspg)


Pscf++ 0.7
==========

Released Nov. 11, 2021

First tagged version that includes Pspg GPU code, as described in article:
