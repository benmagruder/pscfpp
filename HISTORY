= PSCF (C++/Cuda) History  =
============================

This file documents changes to the C++/Cuda version of PSCF. Source code 
for this project is in the dmorse/pscfpp github.com repository.

The following labels are used below to indicate which programs or sets of
programs are affected by specific changes:

  pc  - CPU code for periodic structures (pscf_pc)
  pg  - GPU code for periodic structures (pscf_pg)
  fd  - CPU finite difference code for 1D problems (pscf_fd)
  all - all programs (fd, pc, and pg)
