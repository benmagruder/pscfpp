# PSCF - Polymer Self-Consistent Field Theory (C++/CUDA)

PSCF is a package of software for solving the Edwards-Helfand
self-consistent field theory (SCFT) of polymer liquids. The acronym
PSCF stands for "Polymer Self-Consistent Field". The version described 
here is written primarily in C++, with GPU accelerated code in CUDA.

## History

This C++/CUDA version of PSCF is intended to supersede an older Fortran 
program of the same name. The older Fortran PSCF program is maintained 
in a separate github.com repository at https://github.com/dmorse/pscf.
This new version currently provides almost all of the capabilities of
the older Fortran program, and several important new capabilities, as
discussed below.

Differences between the C++/CUDA version of PSCF and the older Fortran
version and expected advantages of the new code include:

   - The new version is an extensible package of several different
     programs designed for use with different geometries, boundary
     conditions, algorithms or hardware, implemented within a common
     framework.

   - The new version enables simulations of mixtures containing arbitrary
     acyclic branched polymers, in addition to the linear block
     polymers and linear homopolymers allowed by the Fortran PSCF code.

   - The new version enables use of graphics processing units (GPUs) to
     dramatically accelerate some programs.

## Programs

PSCF currently contains code for three programs:

   - **pscf_fd** : The program pscf_fd is is designed to treat 
     one-dimensional problems in Cartesian, cylindrical or spherical 
     coordinates, using a simple finite difference method to solve 
     the underlying partial differential equation. It is useful for 
     treating problems involving flat and curved interfaces, as well 
     as cylindrical or spherical copolymer micelles.  The suffix "fd" 
     stands for "finite difference".
     
   - **pscf_pc** : The pscf_pc rogram is designed to treat structures
     that are periodic in 1, 2 or 3 dimensions, using a pseudo-spectral
     algorithm and conventional CPU hardware. This program provides 
     capabilities analogous to those of the older PSCF Fortran program, 
     at a similar level of performance.  The suffix "pc" stands for 
     "periodic CPU".  
     
   - **pscf_pg** : The pscf_pg program uses GPU-accelerated variant
     of pscf_pc.  It is based on algorithms similar to those used in 
     pscf_pc, with almost identical features but provides higher 
     performance for sufficiently large systems. The suffix "pg" 
     stands for "periodic GPU". 

## Features

All PSCF programs are designed to treat an incompressible mixture 
containing any number of block polymers, homopolymers and small molecule 
(point-like) solvent molecular species. All polymeric species are 
treated using the standard Gaussian model of each polymer block as a 
continuous random walk.

Features that are common to all of the PSCF programs include:

  - Ability to treat mixtures of any number of block polymers, 
    homopolymers, and solvent species

  - Arbitrarily complex acyclic branched block polymers, in addition to 
    linear block polymers

  - Canonical, grand-canonical or mixed statistical ensembles - users 
    may specify either a volume fraction or a chemical potential for 
    each molecular species

  - Efficient simulation of sequences of parameter choices along a path
    in parameter space ("sweeps"), using extrapolation to construct
    initial guesses

  - Efficient Anderson-mixing iteration algorithms

  - Examples of converged solutions and input scripts

  - Python tools for data analysis

  - Thorough user and developer documentation provided as a web manual

  - Open source code written in object oriented C++

Features specific to the pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs for periodic 
structures include:

  - Accurate pseudo-spectral solution of the modified diffusion equation

  - Ordered phases with 1, 2 or 3 dimensional periodicity

  - All possible 2D and 3D lattice systems (i.e., orthorhombic, monoclinic,
    etc.)

  - Automatic optimization of unit parameters so as to minimize free 
    energy

  - Imposition of any user-selected space-group symmetry

  - Built-in "database" of all 230 3D space groups and 17 2D plane groups

  - Availability of a companion package 
    [Polymer Visual](<https://github.com/kdorfmanUMN/polymer_visual/>)
    for visualization of periodic structures

Features specific to the pscf_pc CPU program for periodic structures are:

  - Inhomogeneous density constraints (a "mask")

  - External fields

  - Thin polymer films

The mask and external field features are used in pscf_pc to implement 
simulations of thin films. A mask is used to constrain a polymer 
material to a slit within a periodic supercell, and localized external 
fields are used to represent selective interactions with the top and 
bottom surfaces.

## Getting the source code

The PSCF C++/CUDA source code is maintained in the github repository

   <https://github.com/dmorse/pscfpp>.

The source code may be obtained by using a git version control system
client to clone the repository. To do so on a machine with a git client,
enter the command:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/dmorse/pscfpp.git
```
Note the use of the --recursive option to the git clone command. This
is necessary to clone several git submodules that are maintained in
separate repositories. This command will create a new directory called
pscfpp/ that contains all of the source code and associated
documentation, including all required git submodules.

We do *not* recommend that users obtain the source code by simply
downloading a zip or tar file from the PSCF github repository, because 
this file will not contain source code for the other git repositories 
that are automatically downloaded and installed as submodules by the 
above git command.

## Documentation

PSCF is distributed with source files for an html web manual. A copy
of a recent version of this manual is available online at

  <https://dmorse.github.io/pscfpp-man>

After cloning the source code, users can also use the 
[doxygen](<https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html>) documentation
generation program to generate a local copy of the web manual.
To do this, the doxygen application must be installed on your computer, 
and the directory containing the doxygen executable must be in your 
command search PATH. To generate documentation:

   - Change directory (cd) to the pscfpp/ root directory

   - Enter "make html"

This should create many html files in the docs/html subdirectory of the 
pscfpp/ root directory.  To begin reading the resulting documentation, 
point a web browser at the file docs/html/index.html within this 
directory.  This file is the main page of the manual.

## Dependencies

PSCF has been developed on both linux and and Mac OS X operating systems,
and is designed to run on these or other unix-like systems.

The pscf_fd and pscf_pc CPU programs depend on the following external 
libraries:

  - [GSL](<https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>) - GNU Scientific Library

  - [FFTW](<https://www.fftw.org/>) Fast Fourier Transform library

The pscf_fd one-dimensional program pscf_fd requires only GSL, while
pscf_pc program relies on both GSL and FFTW.

The GPU-accelerated pscf_pg program can only run on a computer with an
appropriate NVIDIA GPU and an NVIDIA CUDA development kit.

Procedures for installing these dependencies are different for different 
operating system environments and different package managers. Instructions 
for some common environments are given in the web manual.

## Compiling

The PSCF source code is written using C++ as the primary language, with
CUDA used in pscf_pg for GPU acceleration. PSCF is only provided in source 
file format, and so must be compiled from source.

The build system used to compile and install PSCF relies on standard 
unix utilities that are available in any unix-like environment. To compile 
and run this or other unix software on Mac OS X, the user must first 
install the Mac OS X unix command line tools. 

Complete directions for compiling and installing PSCF are provided in
section 2 of the [web manual](<https://dmorse.github.io/pscfpp-man>).
A brief summary is given below of instructions for steps that must be 
taken after cloning the git repository and installing all of the 
required dependencies:

   - Add the pscfpp/bin directory to your linux command search PATH
     environment variable. This is where executables will be installed.

   - Add the pscfpp/lib/python directory to your PYTHONPATH environment 
     variable. This provides access to python scripts used by the build 
     system.

   - Run the pscfpp/setup script by entering "./setup" from the pscfpp/ 
     root directory, with or without an optional filename argument. 
     This script installs default versions of several files that are 
     required by the build system. The setup script usually only needs 
     to be run once, before compiling for the first time.  In a linux 
     environment, it is usually sufficient to run the setup script 
     without a filename argument.  See Section 2.6 of the 
     [web manual](<https://dmorse.github.io/pscfpp-man>) for more 
     information about how to invoke the setup script for Apple OS X.

   - To compile and install only CPU-based programs in the package on
     a computer that does not have an appropriate NVIDA GPU, enter
     "make all" from the pscfpp/ root directory immediately after 
     running the setup script.

   - To compile all PSCF programs on a machine that has an
     appropriate NVIDA GPU and a CUDA development kit, including
     GPU-enabled programs, first enter "./configure -c1" from the 
     pscfpp/ root directory to enable compilation of CUDA code, 
     use the -a option of the configure script to set the correct
     GPU architecture for your system, and then enter "make all" 
     to compile. 

The "make all" command installs all resulting executable files in the 
pscfpp/bin directory.

## Command line usage

PSCF is a package containing three different SCFT programs (pscf_fd,
pscf_pc, and pscf_pg) that designed for different geometries, using 
different algorithms or different computer hardware.  To perform a
calculation, Each of these programs must read a parameter file and 
a command file. The parameter file, which is processed first, is a 
fixed-format file that contains parameters required to describe 
the physical system of interest and initialize the program before 
performing any computation. The command file is a script that contains 
a sequence of commands that are read and executed in the order that 
they appear.  Contents and syntax for PSCF parameter and commands 
files are discussed in Sec. 3 of the web manual. 

The command file usually contains names of input and output field 
data files as arguments to commands that read or write these files. 
Specifically, commands for a standard SCFT calculation normally specify 
the name of a file that contains an initial guess for monomer chemical 
potential fields, and names of files to which final chemical potential 
and monomer concentration fields should be written.

The usual command line syntax for invoking pscf_fd is
```
pscf_fd -e -p param -c command
```
where "param" denotes the name of a parameter file, and "command" denotes 
the name of a command file.  The -p and -c options are required.

The "-e" command line option in the above example is not required, but 
causes the program to "echo" the parameter file to standard output as 
this file is being processed. Use of this option makes it easier to 
debug any failure arising from a syntax error in this file. 

The pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs require the dimensionality of the
structure as an additional command line parameter, which specifies the 
number 1, 2, or 3 of coordinates along which the structure is periodic.  
This provided as an integer argument of the -d option.  The usual syntax 
for invoking pscf_pc for a three dimensionally periodic structure (e.g., 
a network phase or an arrangement of spheres), while also using the -e  
option, is thus
```
pscf_pc -d 3 -e -p param -c command
```
The syntax for a simulation of one-dimensional lamellar phase would 
instead use 1 as the argument of the -d option. The syntax for invoking 
pscf_pg is the same as that for pccf_pc, except for the program name.

The above examples would both write log output that is produced during 
execution to the user's screen (i.e., to standard output).  This log 
output may instead be redirected to a file by using the unix ">" 
standard output redirection operator. For example, a command such as 
```
pscf_pc -d 3 -e -p param -c command > log
```
would redirect log output that is written during simulation of a 
3-dimensional periodic structure to a file named "log" in the current 
working directory. This form of the command would normally be used when 
a program is run from within a queue on a shared computer cluster.

## Examples

To learn the syntax of the input files required by PSCF, it is useful to 
examine examples.  The directory pscfpp/examples contains many examples 
of input files for different types of SCFT calculations.  Top level 
subdirectories of the examples/ directory contain examples for different 
PSCF programs (pscf_fd, pscf_pc, or pscf_pg). 

Subdirectory examples/fd contains examples for the 1D 
finite-difference program pscf_fd. Top level subdirectories of the
directory examples/fd contain examples for planar, cylindrical and 
spherical geometries, as indicated by the subdirectory names. One 
or more example is given for each geometry.

Subdirectory examples/pc contains examples for the pscf_pc CPU program. 
Top level subdirectories of examples/pc contain solutions for a particular 
type of physical system. For example, the directory examples/pc/diblock 
contains examples for a diblock copolymer melt.  Subdirectories of 
examples/pc/diblock contain examples for lamellar, hexagonal, and BCC 
structures, among others.

Subdirectory examples/pg contains examples for the pscf_pg program for 
periodic structures. Subdirectories are organized in a manner similar 
to that used for the examples/pc directory tree.

We refer to a directory that contains all of the input files for a single 
example or a set of very closely related examples as an example directory.  
Each such example directory contains at least one parameter file (usually 
named "param"), at least one command file (usually named "command"), and 
an input chemical potential field (w field) file. Example directories 
that contain input files for two or more examples usually contain a single
file that contains an initial guess for the chemical potential field, but 
may contain different parameter or command files for use in different 
examples.

Example directories that contain files for a single example usually
contain a shell script named "run" that can be executed to run the 
example using the supplied input files.  The simplest way to run such an 
example is thus to change directory (cd) to the relevant example directory 
and enter "./run" from within that directory. (Note the use of the 
prefix "./", which tells the operating system to look for the run script 
in the current working directory).  Users may also inspect the text of 
such a run script to see the exact command used to run the example. 
Example directories that contain input files for two or more closely 
related examples may contain several such scripts with names that are 
variants of "run", each of which can be execute to run a specific 
example. 

Each example directory also usually contains a script named "clean" that 
can be executed to remove all output files that are created by running 
the example.
