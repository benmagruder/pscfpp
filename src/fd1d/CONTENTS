This directory contains C++ files specific to the implementation of 
a one-dimensional finite difference implementation of polymer SCFT.
All code in this directory is defined in C++ namespace Pscf::Fd1d.

Subdirectories:

domain/    - classes that define the spatial domain
iterator/  - iterative SCF equation solvers
misc/      - miscellaneous utility classes
solvers/   - modified diffusion equation solvers
sweep/     - classes to implement continuation of solutions ("sweep")
tests/     - unit cell tests for Fd1d code

Doxygen documentation files:

fd1d.mod     - definition of Fd1d doxygen module 
pscf_fd.dox  - command line interface documentation for pscf_fd


Main Program Usage:

The usual command line usage is to invoke

     pscf_fd -e -p param -c command

from the directory containing the files "param" and "command". Here, 
"param" denotes the name of a parameter file and "command" denotes 
the name of a command file.  The -e option causes the parameter file to 
be echoed to standard output as it is read.  

See the html documentation for information about the format of the
parameter and command files.
