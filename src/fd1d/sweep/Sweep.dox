\page fd1d_Sweep_page Sweep

Pscf::Fd1d::Sweep<D> is a base class that defines the general behavior
that is expected of any SCFT parameter sweep. In the param file, a subclass
of Sweep<D> may optionally be included as a subblock of \ref fd1d_System_page. 

In this version of the software, there is only one type of Sweep that can
be used in Pspc: a LinearSweep. For a description of the parameters within 
this Sweep block, follow the link in the table.
