The src/prdc directory contains source code for treating periodic
crystals and fields with periodic boundary conditions. 

All source code in this directory is defined in namespace Pscf::Prdc, 
and may use classes and functions defined in namespace Util (directory
src/util) or parent namespace Pscf (directory src/pscf).  Code in 
Pscf::Prdc may be used in the pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs for periodic 
boundry conditions.

Nested namespaces:

  - Code in prdc/cpu is in nested namespace Pscf::Prdc::Cpu
  - Code in prdc/cuda is in nested namespace Pscf::Prdc::Cuda

Subdirectories:

   crystal/  - unit cells, space groups, and symmetrized basis
   cpu/      - classes that define fields, only used on a CPU
   cuda/     - classes that define fields, only used on a GPU
   field/    - shared base classes and utilities for fields
   iterator/ - tools and base classes for iterators
   tests/    - unit tests for code in src/prdc

Makefile and makefile fragments:

makefile     - main makefile for src/prdc directory tree
sources.mk   - list of source files in src/prdc (makefile fragment)
patterns.mk  - pattern rules for use in src/prdc (makefile fragment)
include.mk   - header of makefile file includes (makefile fragment)
