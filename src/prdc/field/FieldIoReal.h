   /**
   * File input/output operations and format conversions for fields.
   *
   * This class provides functions to read and write arrays that contain
   * fields in any of three representations (symmetry-adapted basis,
   * r-space grid, or Fourier k-space grid), and to convert among these
   * representations. The member functions that implement field IO 
   * operations define the file formats for these field representations.
   *
   * <b>Template parameters:</b>
   *
   *    - D    : dimension of space, i.e., 1, 2, or 3
   *    - RFRT : real field r-grid type, e.g., RField<D> 
   *    - RFKT : real field k-grid type, e.g., RFieldDft<D> 
   *    - FFT  : fast Fourier transform type, e.g., FFT<D> 
   *
   * The FieldIoReal template is a base class for two class templates
   * named FieldIo<int D> defined in namespaces Pscf::Rpc and Pscf::Rpg. 
   * The Pscf::Rpc::FieldIo<int D> template is derived from a partial 
   * specialization of FieldIoReal with parameters RFRT=RField<D>, 
   * RFKT=RFieldDft<D>, and FFT=FFT<D> that are all defined in the
   * Pscf::Cpu namespace, and ll designed use standard CPU hardware. 
   * The analogous template Rpg::Field<D> in the Pscf::Rpg namespace is 
   * derived from a partial specialization of FieldIoReal in which these
   * three parameters are class templates with the same names that are 
   * defined in the Pscf::Cuda namespace, which all use GPU memory. The
   * FieldIo template is used as a base class to reduce duplication of
   * identical or closely analogous code between these two subclasses.
   *
   * <b>Basis construction as side effect of reading field files:</b> 
   * Each member functions that read fields from a file may all construct 
   * a symmetry adapted basis in an associated Basis<D> object as a side 
   * effect of reading a field header. All of these functions call member 
   * function readFieldHeader to read the field file header. If an 
   * associated space group is known but the symmetry adapted basis has 
   * not be initialized upon entry to the readFieldHeader function, then 
   * this function will initialize the Basis<D> object before returning.
   * When a space group is declared in the parameter file, the basis is
   * thus normally constructed as a side effect of the first command
   * that reads a field file.
   *
   * <b> Pure virtual member functions </b>: This class template defines 
   * several pure virtual functions to read and write fields in r-grid and
   * k-grid formats for which different implementations are required for
   * Cpu and Cuda code. Cpu and Cuda implementations of these functions 
   * must differ because the Cuda versions require operations to transfer 
   * data between Cpu and Gpu memory spaces. Implementations of these
   * functions in subclasses may use the function templates declared in
   * file src/prdc/fieldIoUtil.h for core operations of reading and 
   * writing in specific file formats and conversion between basis and
   * k-grid field representations.
