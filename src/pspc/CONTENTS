This directory contains code specific to a pseudo-spectral implementation 
of SCFT for periodic structures on a single CPU.  All code in this 
directory is defined in the namespace Pscf::Pspc.  Most algorithms are 
analogous to those used in the older Fortran PSCF code.  

Subdirectories:

field/     - classes to represent or manipulate fields, including FFTs
iterator/  - iterative SCF equation solvers
solvers/   - modified diffusion equation solvers
sweep/     - classes to implement continuation of solutions ("sweep")
tests/     - unit cell tests for code

C++ Files:

pscf_pc.cpp   - Main program periodic structures on CPU hardware
System.h      - System<D> class template header (main object)
System.tpp    - System<D> class template definition
System.cpp    - System<D> explicit instantiations for D=1,2,3

Makefile and makefile fragments:

source.mk     - list of source files (makefile fragment)
patterns.mk   - pattern rules for src/pspc (makefile fragment)
include.mk    - header of makefile includes (makefile fragment)
makefile      - main makefile for src/pspc directory tree
config.mk     - configuration file (installed by setup script)

Doxygen documentation files:
