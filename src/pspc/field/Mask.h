   /**
   * A field to which the total density is constrained.
   *
   * A Mask<D> contains representations of a single field in two formats:
   * 
   *  - A DArray<double> that contains components of the field in a
   *    symmetry-adapted Fourier expansion (i.e., in basis format). This 
   *    is accessed by the basis() and basis(int) member functions.
   *
   *  - An RField<D> object contains values of the field on the nodes of a
   *    regular mesh. This is accessed by the rgrid() and rgrid(int) member 
   *    functions.
   *
   * A Mask is designed to automatically update one of these 
   * representations when the other is modified, when appropriate. 
   * A pointer to an associated FieldIo<D> is used for these conversions.
   * The setBasis function allows the user to input new components in
   * basis format and internally recomputes the values in r-grid format.
   * The setRgrid function allows the user to reset the field in 
   * r-grid format, but recomputes the components in basis format if 
   * and only if the user declares that the field are known to be
   * invariant under all symmetries of the space group. A boolean
   * flag named isSymmetric is used to keep track of whether the 
   * current field is symmetric, and thus whether the basis format 
   * exists.
