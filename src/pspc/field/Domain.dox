Pscf::Rpc::Domain<D> and Pscf::Pspg::Domain<D> are closely analogous
class templates that are used to represent a periodic unit cell and 
discretization mesh for a D-dimensional periodic structure, as used 
in the pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs, respectively. These closely 
analogous classes use the same parameter file input format.

The parameter file format for a Domain<D> object is:
\code
Domain{
  mesh         Array[Int]
  lattice      string
  groupName*   string
}
\endcode
Parameters and subblocks are described below:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td> lattice </td>
    <td> 
    String identifier for a lattice system (e.g., cubic, orthorhombic,
    hexagonal, etc.). The lattice system is stored internally as a 
    UnitCell<D>::LatticeSype enum value.  A discussion of allowed
    crystal system identifiers and associated unit cell parameters is 
    given \ref user_unitcell_page "here".  
    </td>
  <tr>
    <td> mesh </td>
    <td> 
    A list of D integers on a single line, in which component i is the 
    number of grid points along direction (Bravais basis vector) i. 
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> groupName* </td>
    <td> 
      String identifier for a crystallographic space group (optional).
      A list of valid space group identifiers for each value of D is 
      given \ref user_groups_page "here".
    </td> 
  </tr>
</table>

The optional groupName parameter must be present to enable reading 
and writing of fields in symmetry adapted basis format, or use of any 
algorithm that relies on that field representation. Specifically, the 
groupName parameter must be present to enable iterative solution of SCFT 
equations for structures of known symmetry using any Iterator class 
that uses a symmetry-adapted basis to update the fields, and that thus 
automatically preserves the symmetry.  The groupName parameter can, 
however, generally be left out of parameter files intended for use 
with field theoretic Monte-Carlo (FTMC) calculations, for which the 
fields generally do not exhbit any nontrivial symmetry, as well as 
for "large-cell" SCFT calculations in which no symmetry is imposed.
Fields for simulations or SCFT calculations that do not impose a 
space group symmetry are normally input and output using the r-grid 
field file format.
