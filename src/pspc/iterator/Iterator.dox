\page pspc_Iterator_page Iterator

Pscf::Pspc::Iterator<D> is a base class that defines the general 
behavior that is expected of any SCFT iterator. In the param file, a subclass
of Iterator must be included as a subblock of \ref pspc_System_page. 

In this version of the software, there are two different types of iterators
that can be used, described briefly in the tables below. For a description 
of the parameters within these iterator blocks, follow the links in the table.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td> \ref pspc_AmIterator_page </td>
    <td> Anderson Mixing iterator. Uses the Anderson Mixing algorithm to solve
         the SCFT equations. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> \ref pspc_AmIteratorFilm_page </td>
    <td> Thin Film Anderson Mixing iterator. Uses the Anderson Mixing algorithm 
         to solve the SCFT equations, while imposing a mask (geometric confinement)
         and an external field (wall/polymer chemical interactions) that simulate
         a polymer system that is confined to a thin film geometry. </td>
