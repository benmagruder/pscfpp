# Name: configure
#
# Purpose: Sets macros enable or disable features prior to compiling.
#
# This script should be called prior to compiling in order to enable or
# disable particular compile time features. See the usage examples at the 
# bottom of this documentation block. This version of the script must be
# called from the root of the build directory tree in which a corresponding
# version of the code will built (e.g., the src/ directory for in-source
# compilation or the bld/ directory for out-of-source compilation.  Each 
# build directories contains a copy of this script.  Invoking the configure 
# script in a specific build directory only affects code that is built in 
# that directory.
#
# The configure script works by editing the config.mk makefile fragments 
# in the build directory from which it is called. These files control
# which preprocessor macros are passed to the compiler for code compiled 
# in that build directory.
#
# Synopsis:
#
#      ./configure [options]
#
# Command Line Options: 
#   
# Each of the following options enables or disables a feature. Each such
# options takes 0 or 1 as a required argument, using 1 to denote "enable"
# and 0 to denote "disable".
#
#   -d (0|1)   debugging           (defines/undefines UTIL_DEBUG)
#   -c (0|1)   CUDA code           (defines/undefines PSCF_CUDA) 
#
# This -a option sets an identifier for the GPU architecture to be targeted
# by the NVIDIA cuda compiler. The identifier is a string of the form sm_NN
# where NN is a number that gives the major and minor version number for
# the CUDA "compute capability" for the target GPU. For example, the K40
# GPU has a compute capability 3.5, and takes an architecture code sm_35.
#
#  -a [architecture code]          (defines NVARCH)
#
# These command line options provide information:
#
#   -q        query: prints report of options that are enabled / disabled.
#   -h        help: prints a list of available options 
#
# Examples:
#
# To enable conditional compilation of CUDA code (disabled by default)
#
#   >  ./configure -c1
#
# To disable debugging 
#
#   >  ./configure -d0
