This directory contains C++ and C++/CUDA code used by a GPU-accelerated
program pscf_pg for self-consistent field theory (SCFT) and field 
theoretic theoretic simulation (FTS) with real fields and periodic 
boundary conditions.  All stochastic FTS algorithms implemented in 
this directory rely on a partial saddle point approximation (PS-FTS). 
Code in this directory are generally very closely analogous to that in 
the src/rpc directory, which is used to construct the analogous pscf_pc 
CPU program.

All code in this directory is defined in the namespace Pscf::Rpg.  The 
symbol Rpg stands for 'real periodic GPU'. Code defined in this namespace 
may use classes and functions defined in namespace Util (or directory 
src/util), parent namespace Pscf (directory src/pscf), or namespace 
Pscf::Prdc (directory src/prdc).
