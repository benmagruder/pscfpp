This directory contains C++ and C++/CUDA code used by a GPU-accelerated
pseudo-spectral implementation of SCFT and FTS methods for real fields
with periodic structures.  All code in this directory is defined in the 
namespace Pscf::Rpg. Class designs and algorithms are generally closely 
analogous to those of the pure C++ version of this code located in the 
src/rpc directory.

Subdirectories:

field/      - classes to represent or manipulate fields
solvers/    - classes that solve the modified diffusion equation (MDE)
scft/       - classes used only for self-consistent field theory (SCFT)
fts/        - classes for stochastic field theoretic simulation (FTS)
tests/      - unit cell tests for code
