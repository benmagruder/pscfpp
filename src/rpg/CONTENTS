This directory contains C++ and CUDA code specific to a GPU-accelerated
pseudo-spectral implementation of SCFT and FTS methods for real fields
with periodic structures.  All code in this directory is defined in the 
namespace Pscf::Rpg. Class designs and algorithms are generally closely 
analogous to those of the C++ versions of this code found in the src/rpc 
directory.

Subdirectories:

field/     - classes to represent or manipulate fields, including FFTs
solvers/   - modified diffusion equation solvers
scft/      - classes used only for self-consistent field theory (SCFT)
fts/       - classes for stochastic field theoretic simulation (FTS)
tests/     - unit cell tests for code
