   * descriptors and solvers.  Each Species has values of phi, mu and q, 
   * and an ensemble enumeration value that are defined as protected 
   * variables.  The value of either phi or mu must be provided as an 
   * input parameter, and value of the other variable must then be 
   * computed. The class that actually solves the single single-molecule 
   * statistical mechanics problem must be a subclass of Species so that 
   * it may directly modify the protected variable phi or mu (depending 
   * on the ensemble) and q.
