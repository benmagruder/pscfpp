   /**
   * Enumeration and functions to specify a model for polymer chains.
   *
   * PSCF allows the use of two types of model for polymer chains, 
   * wich are referred to as the "thread" and "bead" models: The 
   * PolymerModel::Type enumeration type has two allowed values of
   * PolymerModel::Thread and PolymerModel::Bead that each identify 
   * one of these two models. 
   *
   * The "thread" model treats each polymer block as a continuous random
   * walk, and uses numerical approximations that attempt to closely 
   * approximate the behavior of that physical model. Specifically, it 
   * uses a pseudo-spectral scheme with step-size extrapolation to solve 
   * the modified diffusion equation and an Simpson's rule algorithm for 
   * integration with respect to contour coordinates that both converge 
   * rapidly to the behavior of the continuous random walk model with 
   * decreasing contour length step size ds.  The thread model describes 
   * the length of each block by a real value referred to as the "length" 
   * of a block, which can take on any real positive value.
   *
   * The "Bead" model is instead based directly on a model of each block
   * of a block polymer as a string containing an integer number of 
   * discrete beads connected by Gaussian springs.  In the bead model, 
   * the w fields act on the discrete beads, rather * than acting 
   * continuously along the chain. The bead model specifies the length of 
   * a block by an integer value for the number of beads within the block,
   * denoted by "nBead". 
   *
   * Functions defined in the PolymerModel namespace can be used to 
   * set and query the value of a globally accessible pseudo-private 
   * PolymerModel::Type variable that specifies which of these two models 
   * should be used throughout a program.  The model type is initialized 
   * to PolymerModel::Thread by default. In PSCF programs that can support
   * either thread or bead models, a choice of model should be made made 
   * in the early stages of program execution and not changed again 
   * before the program terminates.
