   /**
   * Enumeration and functions to specify a model for polymer chains.
   *
   * PSCF allows the use of two types of model for a polymer chain,
   * which we refer to as the "Thread" and "Bead" models:
   *
   * The "Thread" model treats each polymer block as a continuous 
   * random walk, and uses numerical approximations that attempt 
   * to closely approximate the behavior of that physical model. 
   * Specifically, it uses a pseudo-spectral scheme for solving the
   * modified diffusion equation and algorithms for integration with
   * respect to contour coordinates that converges rapidly to the 
   * behavior of that model with decreasing contour length step size.
   * The thread model describes the length of each block by a real
   * value denoted by the "length" of a block, which can take on 
   * any value.
   *
   * The "Bead" model is instead based directly on a model of each
   * block of the polymer as a string of an integer number of beads
   * connected by Gaussian springs, and attempts to approximate the
   * behavior of such a discrete chain as closely as possible. In
   * this model, the w fields act on the discrete beads, rather 
   * than acting continuously along the chain. The bead model 
   * specifies the length of a block by an integer value for the
   * number of beads within the block, denoted by "nBead". 
   * 
   * The two allowed PolymerModel::Thread and PolymerModel::Bead of 
   * the PolymerModel::Type each identify one of these two models. 
   *
   * Functions defined in the PolymerModel namespace can be used
   * to set and query the value of a pseudo-private 
   * PolymerModel::Type that specifies which model should be used 
   * throughout a program.  The model type is initialized to
   * PolymerModel::Thread by default.  In PSCF programs that can 
   * support either thread or bead models, a choice of model should 
   * be made made in the early stages of program execution and not
   * not changed again before the program terminates.
