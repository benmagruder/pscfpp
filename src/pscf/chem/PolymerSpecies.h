   * A PolymerSpecies has an array of Vertex objects and an associated
   * array of Edge objects that, together, provide a description of the
   * connectivity and properties of blocks with a polymer polymer, and of 
   * the associated graph.  A PolymerSpecies object is a descriptor for
   * for a polymer species, but does not contain functions or data 
   * structures required to solve the modified diffusion equation (MDE), 
   * and so is not a solver class.
   *
   * Each implementation level sub-namespace of Pscf (R1d, Rpc or
   * Rpg) contains a concrete class named Polymer that is a subclass of
   * Pscf::Polymer species, and that acts as both a descriptor and MDE 
   * solver for the associated species.  Each such implementation level 
   * sub-namespace also contains a class named Block that is a subclass
   * of Pscf::Edge, and that is a descriptor and MDE solver for a single 
   * block. The Polymer class in each such namespace is a subclass of 
   * a class template instantiation PolymerTmpl<Block> that is itself a
   * subclass of PolymerSpecies. 
   * 
   * A PolymerTmpl<Block> class has a private member variable that
   * is an array of Block objects.  The PolymerTmpl class template 
   * defines implementations of the pure virtual edge(int id) member 
   * functions declared by PolymerSpecies, which return a single element
   * of this array as a reference to an Edge.
