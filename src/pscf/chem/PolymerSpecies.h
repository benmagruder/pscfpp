   /**
   * Descriptor for an acyclic branched block polymer.
   *
   * A PolymerSpecies has access to arrays of Edge and Vertex objects
   * that provide a description of the polymer graph, i.e,. of the
   * connectivity and properties of blocks with the polymer.
   *
   * PolymerSpecies is an abstract base class for subclasses that can act 
   * as both descriptors and MDE solvers for a polymer. The implementation
   * of PolymerSpecies class does not contain a member that is an array
   * of Edge objects. Instead, each instance of the PolymerTmpl<Block>
   * class template, which is a subclass of PolymerSpecies, has a member 
   * variable that is array of Block objects, where the template argument
   * Block is the name of a block solver class that must be a subclass of 
   * Edge. The PolymerTmpl<Block> class template also implements the pure 
   * virtual edge(int ) member functions declared by PolymerSpecies, thus 
   * allowing access to any element of this array of Block objects as a 
   * reference to an Edge.  Each implementation of field theory defines
   * a concrete subclass of PolymerTmpl<Block> named Polymer in which 
   * Block is the block solver class appropriate to that implementation.
   * 
   * The PolymerSpecies abstract base class thereby provides an interface 
   * for operations that require a description of a polymer, and that
   * need access to constituent Edge objects, but that do not need access 
   * to the additional member functions of a Block solver subclass that 
   * are used to actually solve the MDE.
