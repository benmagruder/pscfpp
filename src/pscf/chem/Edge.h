   /**
   * Descriptor for a block within an acyclic block polymer.
   *
   * This class defines the block id, monomerId, and vertexIds of a block 
   * within a block polymer. It also defines either the length of a block,
   * for a continuous thread model, or the number of beads in the block
   * for a discrete bead model. 
   *
   * This class serves as a base class for the BlockTmpl class template, 
   * which is a base class for a class named Block in each implementation 
   * level namespace. Each such implementation-levl Block class is thus 
   * a subclass of Edge.
   *
   * The class is designed to store either a value for length (the length
   * of the block) when PolymerModel::isThread(), or a value for nBead
   * (the number of beads in the block) when PolymerModel::isBead(). In
   * the case of a bead model, it also stores a pair of boolean flags 
   * to indicate whether the block owns either or both of the associated
   * vertices It is an error to try to set or get a value for nBead or
   * the vertex ownership flags when a thread model is in use, because
   * these variables are only meaningful for a bead model. Similarly,
   * it is an error to get or set a value for the block length when a
   * bead model is in use, because the length variable is only meaningful
   * in the context of a thread model. 
   *
   * Block objects associated with a polymer are normally stored in an
   * array named blocks. The id value of each block should be set to the
   * element index of the Block within that array.  VertexIds should be 
   * set for all blocks in a block polymer before the associated edges
   * are added to the Vertex objects.

   * block id of linear polymer must be equal to id and id + 1.
   *
   * Bead model:

   * \code
