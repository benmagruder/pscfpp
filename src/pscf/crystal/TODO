TODO (Basis class):

1) Convert TWave::phase to a Rational value. Add Wave::phase member
   to Basis::Wave, which should also be a rational number. Rework
   code to set using phases in Basis using Rational numbers 
   throughout. Write compute to compute coefficients that treats
   common special cases phase = 0, phase = +- 1/2, phase = +- 1/4.

2) Store complex coefficient separately from phase.

3) Possibility: Add a negationId to Basis::Wave. Once you've identified 
   the negation of a vector, why not keep track of it?
