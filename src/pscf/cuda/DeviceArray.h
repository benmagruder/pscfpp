   * be called from the CPU host, but this class does not offer access 
   * to individual elements via the subscript operator, operator[].

   * underlying data. In case 1, the data are owned by this object, so
   * the allocation and destruction of the C array are performed by this
   * object. In case 2, this object is instead "associated" with a slice
   * of an array owned by a different DeviceArray. If this is the case, 
   * this object is not responsible for allocation or destruction of the 
   * underlying C array, and merely acts as a reference to the slice of
   * the other array to which it is associated.
