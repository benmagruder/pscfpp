The AmIteratorGrid iterator used by the pscf_pg programs uses an 
Anderson mixing algorithm in which residual equations and field updates
are formulated using values defined on the nodes of a regular spatial
grid. The algorithm can be used to either solve the SCFT equations for 
a rigid unit cell or to solve the SCFT equations and also optimize the 
unit cell parameters of a flexible unit cell so as to minimize the free 
energy density.

The format of the associated parameter block is identical to that used
by AmIteratorBasis, as described below:
\code
AmIterator{
   epsilon        real 
   maxItr         int
   maxHist        int  
   verbose*         int (0-2, 0 by default)
   outputTime*      bool (false by default)
   errorType*     enumeration ("normResid", "maxResid", or "relNormResid", "relNormResid" by default)
   isFlexible*    bool (0 or 1, 0/false by default)   
   scaleStress*   real (10.0 by default)
}
\endcode
Here, as elsewhere, labels followed by an asterisk (*) represent optional 
parameters. The meaning of the various parameters are described below:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td> <b> Label </b>  </td>
    <td> <b> Description </b>  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> epsilon </td>
    <td> Desired tolerance for convergence - iteration stops if 
         the magnitude of the error drops below epsilon.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> maxItr </td>
    <td> Maximum number of iterations that will be attempted </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> maxHist  </td>
    <td> Maximum number of previous trial solultions that will be 
         retained in memory for used by the AM algorithm. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> verbose* </td>
    <td> Integer level 0-2 for verbosity of log output during iteration.
         Optional, and 0 (concise) by default. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> showTime* </td>
    <td> Set to 1 (true) to report wall clock time components in log file. 
         Optional, and 0 (false) by default. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> errorType </td>
    <td> Identifer for the type of variable used to define scalar
         error . The only allowed values are "maxResid", "normResid", 
         and "relNormResid", as discussed below. Optional, and equal
         to "relNormResid" by default. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> isFlexible </td>
    <td> Set isFlexible true to enable or false to disable iterative 
         optimization of the unit cell parameters so as to minimize the 
         free energy.  
         Optional and false by default.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> scaleStress </td>
    <td> Constant factor by which stress components are multipled in
         the definition of the residual  attempted if isFlexible is
         true (optional). </td>
  </tr>
</table>
The iterative loop exits if the number of iterations has reaches
maxItr or if the magnitude of the scalar error drops below epsilon. 

Further details are given in the documentation for the Pspc 
\ref pspc_AmIterator_page "AmIterator" algorithm.
