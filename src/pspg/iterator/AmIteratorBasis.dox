The AmIteratorBasis iterator used by the pscf_pg programs is closely
analogous to the \ref pspc_AmIterator_page "AmIterator" algorithm used
by the pscf_pc programs. Both algorithms are based on a formalation of
the Anderson mixing algorithm in which both the residual vector and the
vector of unknowns are formulated using expansions in symmetry-adapted
basis functions. Both algorithm can be used to either solve the SCFT 
equations for a rigid unit cell or to solve the SCFT equations and also 
optimize the unit cell parameters of a flexible unit cell so as to 
minimize the free energy density.

The format of the associated parameter block is identical to that used
by the corresponding pscf_pc algorithm, and is described more formally 
below:
\code
AmIterator{
   maxItr         int
   epsilon        real 
   maxHist        int  
   verbose*         int (0-2, 0 by default)
   outputTime*      bool (false by default)
   errorType*     enumeration ("normResid", "maxResid", or "relNormResid", "relNormResid" by default)
   isFlexible*    bool (0 or 1, 0/false by default)   
   scaleStress*   real (10.0 by default)
}
\endcode
Here, as elsewhere, labels followed by an asterisk (*) represent optional 
parameters. The meaning of the various parameters are described below:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td> <b> Label </b>  </td>
    <td> <b> Description </b>  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> maxIter </td>
    <td> Maximum number of iterations that will be attempted </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> epsilon </td>
    <td> Desired tolerance for convergence - iteration stops if 
         the magnitude of the error drops below epsilon.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> maxHist </td>
    <td> Maximum number of previous trial solultions that will be 
         retained in memory for used by the AM algorithm. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> verbose* </td>
    <td> Integer level 0, 1, 2 for verbosity of log output during iteration.
         Optional, and 0 (concise) by default. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> showTime* </td>
    <td> Set to 1 (true) to report wall clock time components in log file. 
         Optional, and 0 (false) by default. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> errorType* </td>
    <td> Identifer for the type of variable used to define scalar
         error . The only allowed values are "maxResid", "normResid", 
         and "relNormResid". Optional, and equal to "relNormResid" 
         by default. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> isFlexible </td>
    <td> Set isFlexible true to enable or false to disable iterative 
         optimization of the unit cell parameters so as to minimize the 
         free energy.  
         Optional and false by default.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> scaleStress </td>
    <td> Constant factor by which stress components are multipled in
         the definition of the residual  attempted if isFlexible is
         true (optional). </td>
  </tr>
</table>
The iterative loop exits if the number of iterations has reaches
maxItr or if the magnitude of the scalar error drops below epsilon. 

Further discussion of the meanings of some variables is given in the 
documentation for the Pspc \ref pspc_AmIterator_page "AmIterator" 
algorithm.
