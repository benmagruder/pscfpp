This directory contains C++ and CUDA code specific to a GPU-accelerated
pseudo-spectral implementation of SCFT for periodic structures.  All
code in this directory is defined in the namespace Pscf::Pspg. Class
designs and algorithms are closely analogous to those of the C++ version
of this code in the src/pspc directory.

Subdirectories:

field/     - classes to represent or manipulate fields, including FFTs
iterator/  - iterative SCF equation solvers
math/      - CUDA resources and kernels for mathematical operations
solvers/   - modified diffusion equation solvers
sweep/     - classes to implement continuation of solutions ("sweep")
tests/     - unit cell tests for code

C++ Files:

pscf_pg1.cpp  - Main program for 1D problems (e.g., lamellar)
pscf_pg2.cpp  - Main program for 2D problems (e.g., hex phase)
pscf_pg3.cpp  - Main program for 3D problems (e.g., BCC phase)
System.h      - System<D> class template header (main object)
System.tpp    - System<D> class template definition
System.cpp    - System<D> explicit instantiations for D=1,2,3

Makefile and makefile fragments:

source.mk     - list of source files (makefile fragment)
patterns.mk   - pattern rules for src/pspc (makefile fragment)
include.mk    - header of makefile includes (makefile fragment)
makefile      - main makefile for src/pspc directory tree
config.mk     - configuration file (installed by setup script)

Doxygen documentation files:

pspg.mod      - definition of Pspg doxygen module 
pscf_pg1.dox  - command line interface documentation for pscf_pg1
pscf_pg2.dox  - command line interface documentation for pscf_pg2
pscf_pg3.dox  - command line interface documentation for pscf_pg3


Main Program Usage:

Users must invoke different executable files for problems involving 
structures that are periodic in different numbers of dimensions.  The 
executable programs for 1, 2 and 3 dimensionally periodic structures 
are named pscf_pg1, and pscf_pg2 and pscf_pg3, respectively.  Examples 
of the usage of these programs are provided in the directory 
pscfpp/examples/pc/diblock.

The usual command line usage for doing a 3D SCFT calculation (e.g., 
the one in directory examples/pspc/diblock/bcc) is to invoke

     pscf_pg3d -e -p param -c command

from the directory containing the files "param" and "command". Here, 
"param" denotes the name of a parameter file and "command" denotes 
the name of a command file.  The -e option causes the parameter file to 
be echoed to standard output as it is read.  To perform a 2D (e.g., a 
hexagonal phase) or 1D calculation (a lamellar phase), one would 
instead invoke the executable pscf_ps2d or pscf_ps1d, respectively. 

See the html documentation for information about the format of the
parameter and command files.
