--------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0

Pscf:

1) Clean up reading of basis files constructed with different grid.
   Consider creating new file format version.

2) Review and modify interface of AmIteratorTmpl

3) Separate code to compute idemp and chi_inv from ChiInteraction.

Pspg:

1) Review and clean up redundant GPU kernels (leave for v1.1?)

Docs:

1) Fully document param file formats for all classes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.1

Pscf
-----

1) Change treatment of phases in Basis to explicitly store and manipulate
Rational number phases, compute coefficients only at the very end.

2) Introducing new v2.0 field file formats for basis and rgrid. 
Basis would contain the mesh. Rgrid would be output in convention C order.

3) Introduce a convention in Basis in which pairs of related open stars 
are always listed in the same order (this helps complete the basis field 
API).

Pspc:
-----

1) Introduce working prototype of Field Theoretic Monte Carlo

Docs:

1) Develop read-the-docs user manual documentation.

2) Improve developer documentation regarding build system, Parameter IO

Tools:
------

1) Develop python scripts to read output files and analyze sweeps

Docs
-----

1) Write a first draft of a latex algorithms and theory manual, or publish 
as an article in a computational science oriented journal.
