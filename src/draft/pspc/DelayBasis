Goals
------

1) Make it possible to delay construction of a basis until the first time a field file 
   is read.

2) Avoid unnecessary reconstruction of the basis when the same space group and unit
   cell type appear in multiple field files. 

Comments
--------

1) The number of basis functions is not known until we construct a basis, and may change
   if we change the basis. Delaying the construction of basis thus requires us to delay
   allocating all arrays that hold field components in symmetry-adapted basis format.
   We may also have to make provisions for re-allocating them if necessary.

2) This may require that we construct a basis withn the read functions of Pspc::FieldIo,
   since the existence of an appropriate basis is used in some of the read functions.

3) In order to check validity of an existing basis, and avoid unnecessary 
   reconstruction of a valid basis, the functions that decide whether to construct a
   basis must have access to the space group name string and CrystalSystem enumeration
   value.

Proposals
---------

1) Modify WFieldContainer and CFieldContainer to allow allocation and de-allocation
   of basis and r-grid fields separately (allocateBasis, delllocateBasis, allocateRGrid,
   allocateRGrid, and setNmonomer). Continue to require that nMonomer is set once and 
   never changed.

2) Modify basis so as to internally store the space group name string and a copy of
   the unit cell that was used to create it.  Make both of these publically accessible
   as const references for read access. Read access to  the space group string and 
   crystal system enumeration can be used to check if the basis is suitable for a new
   field or crystal. The parameters of the unit cell stored in the Basis simply record 
   are less important, but record which unit cell was used to create the current basis, 
   which can effect the ordering of basis functions.

3) In FieldIo, remove the groupNamePtr_ and instead use the name stored in the basis
   as the relevant identifier.

4) In FieldIo, make the basisPtr_ non-const in order to allow it to be reconstructed
   if necessary.

5) Check that it is possible to clear and reconstruct the Basis.

6) Modify the FieldIo read functions to check the characteristics of the basis, 
   and construct / reconstruct the basis only if necessary, re-use if appropriate.

7) Provide some method for the read functions of FieldIo to inform the calling function
   when they have constructed a new basis, so that the system can re-allocate other 
   arrays with dimensions that depend on nBasis.
