\page rpc_McSimulator_page Rpc::McSimulator

An instance of the class Pscf::Rpc::McSimulator<D> contains all of the
algorithms and objects that are needed to implement a partial saddle-point
field theoretic simulation (PS-FTS) using Monte-Carlo sampling, but that 
are not needed for self-consistent field (SCFT) calculation. The associated 
parameter file block is one of two possible option (McSimulator or 
BdSimulator) for the optional, selectable "Simulator" subblock of the main 
System block of the parameter file. 

The format of this parameter file block is given below in skeleton form:
\code
McSimulator{
  Compressor#{ ... }
  seed* int
  Perturbation#*{ ... }
  Ramp#*{ ... }
  McMoveManager#{ ... }
  AnalyzerManager*{ ... }
}
\endcode
Here, as elsewhere in this documentation, the suffixes # and * after a 
sub-block name denote selectable and optional elements, respectively. 
The only difference between the format of an McSimulator block and that
of a BdSimulator block is the presence of an McMoveManager sub-block for 
an McSimulator where a BdStep sub-block would appear for a BdSimulator.

Each allowed element of a McSimulator block is described in more detail 
below:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td> Compressor# </td>
    <td>
    A Compressor is an iterative solver that adjusts the Lagrange
    multiplier chemical potential field in order to satisfy the 
    incompressibility constraint, thus finding a partial-saddle point 
    field condition. (selectable and required)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> seed* </td>
    <td> Optional random seed, which must be a positive integer. If no 
    seed is set, the random number generator will be initialized using 
    a seed generated from the system clock. (optional)
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Perturbation#* </td>
    <td>
    An optional Perturbation block defines a perturbation or modification
    of the field theoretic Hamiltonian, as for, e.g., the Einstein crystal
    thermodynamic integration method.  (selectable and optional)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Ramp#* </td>
    <td>
    An optional Ramp block prescribes a continuous change in one or more
    system parameters during the course of a simulation, as used during
    continuous thermodynamic integration. Though this is coded as an
    optional selectable block, the only option that is currently implemented 
    is a LinearRamp which prescribes a change in one or more parameters that 
    change linearly with time (i.e., with the simulation step counter).
    (selectable and optional)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> McMoveManager# </td>
    <td>
    The McMoveManager block contains a set of one or more McMove objects
    that describe Monte Carlo moves that will be used during an MC PS-FTS
    simulation. (selectable and required)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> AnalyzerManager#* </td>
    <td>
    The optional AnalyzerManager block contains subblocks that 
    initialize one or Analyzer objects, each of which implements a 
    data analysis and/or data output operation that will be carried 
    out periodically during a simulation (on-the-fly) or during 
    analysis of a field trajectory file (postprocessing). (optional).
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
The Compressor and BdStep must both be present in order to perform a 
field theoretic simulation (command SIMULATE), but are not needed for 
postprocessing of a field trajectory file. The AnalyzerManager block 
must be present in order to perform postprocess analysis of a 
trajectory file (command ANALYZE).
