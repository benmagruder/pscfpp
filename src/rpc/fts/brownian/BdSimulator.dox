\page rpc_BdSimulator_page Rpc::BdSimulator

An instance of the class Pscf::Rpc::BdSimulator<D> contains all of the
algorithms and parameters that are needed to enable a partial saddle-point
field theoretic simulation (PS-FTS) using Brownian dynamic sampling, but 
that are not needed for self-consistent field (SCFT) calculation. The
associated parameter file block is one of two possible options 
(BdSimulator or McSimulator) for the optional, selectable "Simulator" 
subblock of the main \ref rpc_System_page "System: block of the parameter 
file. 

The format of a BdSimulator block is given below in skeleton form:
\code
BdSimulator{
  seed* int
  BdStep#{ ... }
  Compressor#{ ... }
  Perturbation#*{ ... }
  Ramp#*{ ... }
  AnalyzerManager*{ ... }
}
\endcode
Here, as elsewhere in this documentation, the suffixes # and * after a 
sub-block name denote selectable and optional elements, respectively. 

Each allowed element of a BdSimulator block is described in more detail 
below:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td> Compressor# </td>
    <td>
    A Compressor is an iterative solver that adjusts the Lagrange
    multiplier chemical potential field in order to satisfy the 
    incompressibility constraint, thus finding a partial-saddle point 
    field condition. (selectable and required)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> seed* </td>
    <td> Optional random seed, which must be a positive integer. If no 
    seed is set, the random number generator will be initialized using 
    a seed generated from the system clock. (optional)
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Perturbation#* </td>
    <td>
    An optional Perturbation block defines a perturbation or modification
    of the field theoretic Hamiltonian, as for, e.g., the Einstein crystal
    thermodynamic integration method.  (selectable and optional)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Ramp#* </td>
    <td>
    An optional Ramp block prescribes a continuous change in one or more
    system parameters during the course of a simulation, as used during
    continuous thermodynamic integration. Though this is coded as an
    optional selectable block, the only option that is currently implemented 
    is a LinearRamp which prescribes a change in one or more parameters that 
    change linearly with time (i.e., with the simulation step counter).
    (selectable and optional)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> BdStep# </td>
    <td>
    The BdStep block prescribes an algorithm for a Brownian dynamics 
    step, and gives values for the step size and any other parameters 
    required by that algorithm. (selectable and required)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> AnalyzerManager#* </td>
    <td>
    The optional AnalyzerManager block contains subblocks that 
    initialize one or Analyzer objects, each of which implements a 
    data analysis and/or data output operation that will be carried 
    out periodically during a simulation (on-the-fly) or during 
    analysis of a field trajectory file (postprocessing). (optional).
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
The Compressor and BdStep must both be present in order to perform a 
field theoretic simulation (command SIMULATE), but are not needed for 
postprocessing of a field trajectory file. The AnalyzerManager block 
must be present in order to perform postprocess analysis of a 
trajectory file (command ANALYZE).
