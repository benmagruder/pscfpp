\page rpc_BdSimulator_page Rpc::BdSimulator

An instance of the class Pscf::Rpc::BdSimulator<D> contains all of the
algorithms and parameters that are needed to enable a partial saddle-point
field theoretic simulation (PS-FTS) using Brownian dynamic sampling, but 
that are not needed for self-consistent field (SCFT) calculation. The
associated parameter file block is one of two possible options (BdSimulato
r or McSimulator) for the optional, selectable "Simulator" subblock of the 
main \ref rpc_System_page "System" block of the parameter file. 

The format of a BdSimulator block is given below in skeleton form:
\code
BdSimulator{
  seed* int
  BdStep#*{ ... }
  Compressor#*{ ... }
  Perturbation#*{ ... }
  Ramp#*{ ... }
  AnalyzerManager*{ ... }
}
\endcode
Here, as elsewhere in this documentation, the suffix # after a subblock
name indicates a selectable subblock, and a * star after any parameter
file element indicates an optional element. Every element of this block 
is formally optional, but particular commands (such as the SIMULATE)
command require the presence of a minimal set of elements.

Each allowed element of a BdSimulator block is described in more detail 
below:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td> seed* </td>
    <td> Optional random seed, which must be a positive integer. If no 
    seed is set, the random number generator will be initialized using 
    a seed generated from the system clock. (optional)
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> BdStep#* </td>
    <td>
    The BdStep block prescribes an algorithm for a Brownian dynamics setp,
    and gives values for the step size and any other parameters required
    by that algorithm. (selectable and optional)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Compressor#* </td>
    <td>
    A Compressor is an iterative solver that adjusts the pressure-like
    chemical potential field component in order to satisfy the mean-field
    incompressibility constraint, thus satisfying the partial-saddle point 
    criterion. (selectable and optional)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Perturbation#* </td>
    <td>
    An optional Perturbation block defines an additive perturbation of 
    the field theoretic Hamiltonian, as for, e.g., the Einstein crystal
    thermodynamic integration method.  (selectable and optional)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Ramp#* </td>
    <td>
    An optional Ramp block initializes an algorithm to continuously change 
    one or more system parameters during the course of a simulation.  Though 
    this is coded as an optional selectable block, the only option that is 
    currently implemented is a LinearRamp that causes one or more parameters
    to vary linearly with BD step index. (selectable and optional)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> AnalyzerManager#* </td>
    <td>
    The optional AnalyzerManager block contains one or more subblocks 
    that each initialize an analyzer algorithm. Each each analyzer 
    implements a data analysis and/or data output operation that 
    will be carried out periodically during a simulation (on-the-fly) 
    or during analysis of a field trajectory file (postprocessing). 
    (optional).
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
Relationships among subblocks of BdSimulator:

  - The BdStep and Compressor blocks must both be present in order to
    perform a BD simulation (command SIMULATE). Both of these elements
    may be omitted, however, from a parameter file that is used to 
    initialize postprocessing of a field trajectory file. 

  - If a BdStep is present, the Compressor block is required.

  - A Ramp is allowed only if a BdStep and Compressor are present,
    since these are algorithms that are only used during a simulation.

  - The AnalyzerManager block must be present in order to postprocess
    a trajectory file (command ANALYZE).
