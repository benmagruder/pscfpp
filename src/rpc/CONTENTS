This directory contains code used in program pscf_pc for self-consistent
field theory (SCFT) and field theoretic simulations (FTS) with real fields 
and periodic boundary conditions, using conventional CPU hardware.  All 
stochastic FTS algorithms implemented in this directory rely on a partial 
saddle point approximation (PS-FTS), which allows the use of real fields. 

All code in this directory is defined in the C++ namespace Pscf::Rpc. The
symbol Rpc stands for 'real periodic CPU' Code defined in Pscf::Rpc may
use classes and functions defined in namespace Util (directory src/util), 
parent namespace Pscf (directory src/pscf), and namespace Pscf::Prdc 
(directory src/prdc).
