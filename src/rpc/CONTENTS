This directory contains code specific to a pseudo-spectral 
implementation of self-consistent field theory (SCFT) and field theoretic 
simulations (FTS) with real fields for periodic structures, running on
CPU hardware.  All code in this directory is defined in the namespace 
Pscf::Rpc.  All FTS algorithms in this namespaced rely on a partial 
saddle point approximation (PS-FTS), which allows the use of real fields. 

Subdirectories:

field/       - classes to represent or manipulate fields
solvers/     - classes to solve the modified diffusion equation (MDE)
scft/        - classes to implement self-consistent field theory (SCFT)
