This directory contains code specific to a pseudo-spectral 
implementation of SCFT and field theoretic simulations (FTS) for 
periodic structures on CPU hardware.  All code in this directory is 
defined in the namespace Pscf::Rpc.  Most algorithms are analogous to
those used in the older Fortran PSCF code.  

Subdirectories:

field/       - classes to represent or manipulate fields
fts/         - classes to implement field-theoretic simulation (FTS)
scft/        - classes to implement self-consistent field theory (SCFT)
solvers/     - classes to solve the modified diffusion equation (MDE)
tests/       - unit tests for code in src/rpc

C++ Files:

System.(h,tpp,cpp) - System<D> class template (main object)
pscf_pc.cpp        - main program for periodic structures on CPU hardware

Makefile and makefile fragments:

sources.mk    - list of source files in src/rpc (makefile fragment)
patterns.mk   - pattern rules for src/rpc (makefile fragment)
