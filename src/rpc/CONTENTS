This directory contains code specific to a pseudo-spectral 
implementation of SCFT and field theoretic simulations (FTS) for 
periodic structures on CPU hardware.  All code in this directory 
is defined in the namespace Pscf::Rpc.  Most SCFT algorithms are 
analogous to those used in the older Fortran PSCF code.  All FTS
algorithms defined here rely on a partial saddle point approximation, 
which allows the use of real fields.
