This directory contains code specific to a pseudo-spectral 
implementation of SCFT and field theoretic simulations (FTS) for 
periodic structures on a single CPU.  All code in this directory is 
defined in the namespace Pscf::Rpc.  Most algorithms are analogous 
to those used in the older Fortran PSCF code.  

Subdirectories:

field/       - classes to represent or manipulate fields
iterator/    - iterative SCF equation solvers
solvers/     - classes to solve the modified diffusion equation (MDE)
sweep/       - classes to implement continuation of solutions ("sweep")
simulate/    - classes to implement field-theoretic simulation (FTS)
tests/       - unit tests for code in src/rpc

C++ Files:

System.h      - System<D> class template header (main object)
System.tpp    - System<D> class template definition
System.cpp    - System<D> explicit instantiations for D=1,2,3
pscf_pc.cpp   - Main program periodic structures on CPU hardware

Makefile and makefile fragments:

patterns.mk   - pattern rules for src/rpc (makefile fragment)
include.mk    - header of makefile includes (makefile fragment)
makefile      - main makefile for src/rpc directory tree
