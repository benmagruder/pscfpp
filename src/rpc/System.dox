\page rpc_System_page Rpc::System

The main object in a pscf_pc program is an instance of a class
Pscf::Rpc::System<D>, in which the integer template parameter D is the 
dimension of space specified by the argument of the "-d" command line 
option. The outermost block of the parameter file for pscf_pc, which 
encloses all of the data in the file, is a block labelled "System". The 
parameter file format for this file block (and thus for the entire file)
is given in skeleton form below
\code
System{
  Mixture{ ... }
  Interaction{ ... }
  Domain{ ... }
  Iterator#*{ ... }
  Sweep#*{ ... }
  Compressor#*{ ... }
  McSimulator*{ ... }
}
\endcode
Subblocks are described below:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td> Mixture </td>
    <td> 
    The Mixture block contains a description of all of the chemical
    species in a mixture, as described in detail 
    \ref user_param_mixture_page "here". (required)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Interaction </td>
    <td> 
    The interaction block for a system described by the "standard model" of
    an incompressible polymer mixture contains a list of Flory-Huggins chi
    parameters, as discussed \ref user_param_example_interaction "here".
    (required)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Domain </td>
    <td>
    The Domain block contains information about the periodic unit
    cell and the computational mesh used to discretize fields in that 
    cell, as described \ref rpc_Domain_page "here". (required)
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Iterator#* </td>
    <td>
    An Iterator implements an iterative algorithm for solving the
    self-consistent field equations. Available algorithms are listed
    \ref scft_param_pc_iterator_sec "here". An Iterator is required
    for any SCFT calculation.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Sweep#* </td>
    <td>
    A Sweep performs a sequence of SCFT calculations along a 
    user-prescribed path through parameter space, as described
    \ref scft_param_sweep_page "here". The block is selectable and
    optional, but the option that is currently provided is a
    LinearSweep (class Pscf::Rpc::LinearSweep). 
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Compressor#* </td>
    <td>
    A Compressor is an iterative solver that adjusts the Lagrange
    multiplier chemical potential field in order to satisfy the 
    incompressibility constraint, also known as a partial-saddle
    point condition. A Compressor is required for all field theoretic
    simulations that can be performed by pscf_pc, all of which are
    based on a partial saddle point approximation.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> McSimulator* </td>
    <td>
    An McSimulator performs a field theoretic Monte Carlo simulation.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
