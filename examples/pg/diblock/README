Each subdirectory of this directory contains an example 
of a periodic phase that can be run on a GPU using the pscf_pg3 
program. To run these examples, you must be logged onto a 
computer or node with an NVIDIA GPU and a CUDA run time 
environment. 

Each of these example directories contains an executable
script named "run" that contains the appropriate form 
of the above command, including the correct values for
nblock and nthread. To run an example, you can thus just
invoke "./run" from the directory containing the executable.
