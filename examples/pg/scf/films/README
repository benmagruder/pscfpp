Each directory for a thin film example also contains
a subdirectory 'init', which contains a python script
that was used to generate the initial guess, either from
scratch or by starting from a converged solution in the
bulk and converting it to a thin film geometry. Users can
use these python scripts as a guide for how to generate 
their own initial guesses for other phases. 

To generate an initial guess, navigate to the init/ 
directory and type:
    ./make_rgrid.py

You can then copy this initial guess to the in/ directory
by navigating back to the main directory (e.g. 1D/) and 
typing
    cp init/c.rf in/c.rf

Then, to run pscf, type:

    pscf_pc -p param -c command -e

Alternatively, you can just type "./generate_guess" to 
call the pre-written executable that will run 
make_rgrid.py and copy the result to the in/ directory,
and then call ./run to run a pscf calculation on this
guess. The 1D/ directory also has a separate set of 
run files with "_flex" appended to the filenames, which
runs a calculation with flexible film thickness.

To delete all files generated by ./generate_guess and 
./run, type "./clean" from any subdirectory of this 
directory. Typing "./clean" from this directory will 
clean all of the subdirectories.
