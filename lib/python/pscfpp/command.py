##
# Class to parse a PSCF command script.
#
# The Script class can read a command script file and store its
# contents in a form that allows particular commands to be accessed and
# modified. 
# 
# Usage: The command:
#
# commands = readCommandFile("commands")
# 
# parses a command file "commands" and returns a Script object,
# which we have named commands.
# 
# Script:
# 
# A Script object is a container for a list of child Command 
# objects.  Each command corresponds to one line in the command script, 
# in which the first field is the label.  Individual commands can be 
# accessed in either of two ways:
#
#   - Commands may be accessed by integer index using the square bracket
#     notation for elements of a python list. If s is a Script,
#     then s[2] is the 3rd command in the script.
#
#   - Each child may be accessed as an attribute with a name given by
#     the label of the child ParamComposite or Parameter. 
# 
# If two or more lines in a command script have the same label (i.e,.
# the same command name), the attribute associated with that label is
# a list in which the first Command with this label is indexed by 0, 
# the second by 1, etc.
#
